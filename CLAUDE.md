# Context for Claude Code: Recursive Creator Project

> **Last Updated:** 2025-11-03
> **Current Phase:** Phase 0 - Project Setup & Auth Implementation
> **Next Session:** Initialize Next.js project and implement dual auth

---

## Project Overview

**Name:** Recursive Creator
**Purpose:** Unified creator hub for Recursive.eco ecosystem
**Domain:** creator.recursive.eco (future)
**Stack:** Next.js 15 + React 19 + Supabase + TypeScript

**What We're Building:**
1. **Story Publisher** - Parents upload images to create children's books
2. **Playlist Wrapper** - Curated YouTube playlists for kids (privacy-enhanced)
3. **Account Hub** - Unified dashboard for all Recursive.eco content

---

## Key Decision: Auth First! ✅

**Decision Made:** Build dual auth (magic link + OTP) BEFORE fun features

**Rationale:**
- Magic links fail on non-Gmail providers
- 3-4 days of auth work saves weeks of frustration
- No refactoring needed later
- Copy pattern to all projects immediately (channels, journal)
- Solid foundation for testing dashboard features

**Timeline:**
- Days 1-4: Implement dual auth
- Days 5+: Build stories, playlists, etc.

---

## Key Decision: Full JSONB Schema ✅

**Decision Made:** Use JSONB-heavy approach (like existing projects)

**Rationale:**
- Small scale (200 users max) → JSONB is plenty fast
- Solo dev → speed > perfect structure
- Infrequent querying → no need for complex optimization
- Claude builds visualizations → don't need Supabase Studio
- **Better for AI features** → JSON format is native for LLMs, embeddings, etc.
- No migrations needed → iterate fast

**See:** `SIMPLE_JSONB_SCHEMA.md` for full schema (3 tables, dead simple)

## Architecture Decisions

### 1. Hybrid Approach (React + Vanilla-Style Viewers)

**Question Resolved:** "Does vanilla HTML have more creative freedom?"

**Answer:** No - it's mostly psychological. React can render identical HTML/CSS/JS.

**Solution:**
- Use Next.js dynamic routes (for auth checks)
- Render vanilla-style components (same UX as recursive-landing)
- Best of both worlds: auth checks + creative freedom

### 2. Private/Unlisted/Public Content

**Requirement:** Users need to preview stories before publishing

**Solution:**
- Server-side permission checks in Next.js routes
- Visibility options: private (owner only), unlisted (anyone with link), public (everyone)
- Preview mode shows unpublished content to owner

### 3. Auth Portability

**Requirement:** Copy auth to channels and journal projects

**Solution:**
- All projects share same Supabase instance
- Copy 4 files, update Supabase email template once
- Works across all projects in ~50 minutes
- See: `AUTH_PORTABILITY.md`

## Technical Context

### Supabase Connection

**Project:** Shared across all Recursive.eco apps
**URL:** https://yoursrpohfbpxoalyoeg.supabase.co (check .env)

**Existing Tables:**
- `channels` - Wellness/creative/learning channels
- `tools` - Community tools (JSONB-heavy, keep as-is)
- `profiles` - User profiles (JSONB-heavy, keep as-is)
- `journal_templates` - Journaling prompts
- `user_documents` - Generic user data (JSONB-heavy, keep as-is)
- `newsletter_subscribers` - Email signups

**New Tables (To Create):**
- `stories` - Story metadata (relational design)
- `story_pages` - Individual story pages
- `playlists` - Playlist metadata (relational design)
- `playlist_items` - Individual videos
- `user_stars` - Cross-project starred content

**Schema Location:** `z.Supabase/schema_20251030.sql`

### Auth Setup

**Current Status:** Magic links only (unreliable)

**Target:** Dual auth (magic link + OTP)

**Implementation:**
1. Update Supabase email template (include `{{ .Token }}`)
2. Create `DualAuth.tsx` component (two-step flow)
3. Create auth callback route
4. Test across email providers

**See:** `AUTH_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` for complete code

## Compliance Considerations

### COPPA (Children's Privacy):
- ✅ Service is parent-facing (not child-directed)
- ✅ No accounts for children
- ✅ Adult affirmation gate on kid content
- ✅ Privacy notice: "We don't collect children's data"

### YouTube Terms:
- ✅ Use `youtube-nocookie.com` (privacy-enhanced)
- ✅ Keep YouTube branding visible
- ✅ No downloading/scraping
- ✅ Clear attribution

### GDPR:
- ✅ Data export already implemented (channels)
- ✅ Account deletion already implemented
- ✅ Copy pattern to creator hub

**See:** `PROJECT_PLAN.md` section on compliance

## Quick Start (Resuming Development)

### If Starting Fresh Session:

**Step 1: Read Context (5 min)**
- Read this file (CLAUDE.md)
- Skim PROJECT_PLAN.md
- Check "Current State" section above

**Step 2: Check Phase**
- Look at "Current State" → what's done, what's next
- If Phase 0 (auth): Read AUTH_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md
- If Phase 1+ (features): Read PROJECT_PLAN.md

**Step 3: Ask User**
- "Ready to continue with [current task]?"
- Confirm any decisions if unclear

**Step 4: Continue**
- Pick up where we left off
- Use TodoWrite to track progress
- Update this file when major decisions are made

### If User Says "Continue" or "Let's go":
- Check "Next Steps" in "Current State" section
- Start with first unchecked task
- Create todos with TodoWrite
- Begin implementation

---

## Important Notes

### Don't Do Without Asking:
- ❌ Don't deploy to production
- ❌ Don't push to git (user handles this)
- ❌ Don't delete existing files
- ❌ Don't modify other projects without permission
- ❌ Don't add emojis unless requested

### Always Do:
- ✅ Use TodoWrite for multi-step tasks
- ✅ Mark todos complete as you finish
- ✅ Copy proven patterns (don't reinvent)
- ✅ Test across email providers (Gmail, Outlook, etc.)
- ✅ Ask for clarification if ambiguous

### Code Style:
- TypeScript (strict mode)
- Tailwind CSS (utility-first)
- Server components by default (use 'use client' when needed)
- Descriptive variable names
- Comments for complex logic

---

## Debugging Tips

### If Auth Issues:
- Check Supabase cookies in browser dev tools
- Verify callback URL in Supabase dashboard
- Check middleware.ts is running
- Test with different email providers

### If Database Issues:
- Check RLS policies (common source of "no rows" errors)
- Verify foreign keys exist
- Look at Supabase logs in dashboard
- Test queries in SQL Editor

### If Build Issues:
- Check Next.js version (15.4.3)
- Verify all imports
- Check middleware.ts path config
- Clear .next folder and rebuild

## Current Session Context

**Date:** 2025-11-03
**Focus:** Phase 0 - Auth implementation (dual: magic link + OTP)
**User Decision:** Auth first (not fun stuff first)
**Schema Decision:** Relational design (not JSONB-heavy)

**Next Immediate Steps:**
1. Initialize Next.js 15 project in this folder
2. Copy auth files from recursive-channels-fresh
3. Implement DualAuth component (see AUTH_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md)
4. Update Supabase email template
5. Test across email providers (Gmail, Outlook, ProtonMail)
6. Copy to channels and journal projects

**Estimated Time:** 3-4 days (Days 1-4 of PROJECT_PLAN.md)

**User is ready to start!** 🚀

## Questions to Ask User (If Resuming and Unclear)

1. "What phase are we on?" (Check Current State)
2. "Should I continue with [next task]?" (Check Next Steps)
3. "Any decisions changed since last session?" (Validate context)
4. "Ready to start implementation?" (Get confirmation)

**If user says "continue," "let's go," or similar:**
→ Check Next Steps, create todos, start work!
