# Phase 9: YouTube Playlist Import - COMPLETE ✅ (2025-11-21)

## Implementation Summary:

**Goal:** Allow batch import of all videos from a YouTube playlist URL (up to 50 videos)

**What Was Built:**

1. **Backend API Route** - `/api/extract-playlist/route.ts`
   - Uses YouTube Data API v3 with `GOOGLE_DRIVE_API_KEY`
   - Extracts playlist ID from various URL formats
   - Fetches up to 50 videos per playlist
   - Returns video IDs, titles, URLs, and thumbnails
   - Error handling for private playlists, invalid URLs, API quota

2. **Frontend State & Handler** - `app/dashboard/sequences/new/page.tsx`
   - State: `showPlaylistModal`, `playlistUrl`, `importingPlaylist`, `playlistError`
   - Handler: `handleImportPlaylist()` function (lines 343-381)
   - Auto-populates bulk textarea with video URLs on success

3. **UI Components**
   - 🎬 Import Playlist button (red) next to Drive folder button (lines 705-711)
   - YouTube Playlist Import modal (lines 1109-1173)
   - Matches Drive folder modal pattern

**User Flow:**
1. Click "🎬 Import Playlist" → Modal opens
2. Paste playlist URL (e.g., `https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLxxx...`)
3. Click "Import Videos" → Backend fetches videos
4. Bulk textarea auto-populated with video URLs
5. Click "Update Sidebar" → Videos added to sequence

**Testing Results:**
- ✅ Successfully imports public playlists
- ✅ Displays helpful error messages for invalid URLs
- ✅ Handles API quota exceeded errors
- ✅ Max 50 videos per playlist (YouTube API limit)

**Environment Variable:**
- Uses `GOOGLE_DRIVE_API_KEY` (same as Drive folder import)
- Both Drive API and YouTube Data API use same Google Cloud API key

**Commits:**
- 1c70de9 - "feat(Phase 9): Add YouTube Playlist Import UI - button and modal"
- bf4df05 - "fix: Use same API key env var for both Drive and YouTube APIs"

**Branch:** `feature/publishing-workflow-20251119`

# Phase 11 Fixes Completed (2025-11-20)

## ✅ Fixes Successfully Merged to Main:

**Fix #8 - Container Cropping Issue** ✅ FIXED
- Added `pb-28` (padding-bottom) to content area in SequenceViewer.tsx:230
- Prevents content from extending behind controls overlay
- **Note:** Fullscreen button STILL not visible after this fix
- **Decision:** Accepted as-is since YouTube provides native controls in creator mode
- Won't fix fullscreen button specifically for creator piece
- File: `components/viewers/SequenceViewer.tsx`

**Fix #9 - YouTube Shorts URL Support** ✅ FIXED
- Added YouTube Shorts pattern: `/youtube\.com\/shorts\/([^&\n?#]+)/`
- Prevents Shorts URLs from being treated as Drive URLs
- Now correctly extracts video ID from `https://youtube.com/shorts/VIDEO_ID`
- File: `app/dashboard/sequences/new/page.tsx:192`

**Fix #7 - YouTube Logo** ❌ CANNOT FIX
- YouTube ToS prohibit hiding logo/branding
- Must keep logo visible for legal compliance
- Already using `modestbranding=1` which minimizes branding as much as allowed

**Commit:** 1af73a2 - "fix(Phase 11): Fix container cropping and YouTube Shorts URL parsing"
**Merged to main:** 2025-11-20

## Project Overview

**Name:** Recursive Creator
**Purpose:** Forge tools for collective meaning-making
**Domain:** creator.recursive.eco (future)
**Stack:** Next.js 15 + React 19 + Supabase + TypeScript

## Who This Is For (The Vulcan Vision) 🔨

**PlayfulProcess = Vulcan, Regent of Taurus (Ascendant)**

*"I build tools for the gods. I want cultural change through popularizing digital culture, creating a collective, giving people the right tools so they can create."*

### Not a Traditional Developer
- **Social worker** (MSW starting 2026) who vibe codes
- **Activist/Artist** following Tillich + Vanessa Andreotti + Bayo Akomolafe (Hospicing Modernity)
- **Toolmaker for the collective**, not platform builder for self
- Cares about **art/activism/spirituality** > software optimization
- **Process over outcome**, **beauty over efficiency**

### The Mission: Gateway Building, Not Gatekeeping
- Build the **forge** (upload tools, frameworks, infrastructure)
- **People** use the forge to **create** (stories, wellness tools, contemplations)
- Creations **feed back** to the collective (channels)
- **Cultural change** through popularized digital creation

### The Recursive Loop:
```
PlayfulProcess builds tools
  ↓
Parents create children's stories
  ↓
Stories published to Kids Stories channel
  ↓
Other families use & are inspired
  ↓
More people create tools & content
  ↓
Collective grows through participation
  ↓
LOOP: Cultural change emerges
```

**This is infrastructure for collective meaning-making, not a personal portfolio.**

---

## What We're Building (Tools for the Collective)

1. **Content Sequence Creator** - Parents/creators upload image stories + curated YouTube playlists with narrative context
   - Stories: Image sequences with text (children's books, visual narratives)
   - Playlists: YouTube videos wrapped in safer, calmer UX with narrative pauses
   - **Unified Viewer**: Both use same beautiful viewer (images + videos mixed together)

2. **YouTube Wrapper Value** - Why wrap playlists instead of using native YouTube?
   - 🎭 **Narrative Context**: Add story pages before/after videos, create "chapters"
   - 🧹 **Clean Embeds**: Hide related videos, remove search, no autoplay chaos
   - 🛡️ **Safer for Kids**: Bounded experience, can't click away to random videos
   - 💬 **Community Reviews**: Trusted recommendations within recursive.eco (future)

3. **Account Hub** - Unified dashboard for all Recursive.eco content
4. **Future: Existential Tarot** - Contemplation tool (Tillich meets digital culture, ontoject path)
5. **Future: AI Contemplation Limits** - Introspection prompts after 10 AI attempts (hospicing modernity practice)

---

## Key Decision: Auth First! ✅

**Decision Made:** Build dual auth (magic link + OTP) BEFORE fun features

**Rationale:**
- Magic links fail on non-Gmail providers
- 3-4 days of auth work saves weeks of frustration
- No refactoring needed later
- Copy pattern to all projects immediately (channels, journal)
- Solid foundation for testing dashboard features

**Timeline:**
- Days 1-4: Implement dual auth
- Days 5+: Build stories, playlists, etc.

---

## Key Decision: Full JSONB Schema ✅

**Decision Made:** Use JSONB-heavy approach (like existing projects)

**Rationale:**
- Small scale (200 users max) → JSONB is plenty fast
- Solo dev → speed > perfect structure
- Infrequent querying → no need for complex optimization
- Claude builds visualizations → don't need Supabase Studio
- **Better for AI features** → JSON format is native for LLMs, embeddings, etc.
- No migrations needed → iterate fast

**See:** `SIMPLE_JSONB_SCHEMA.md` for full schema (3 tables, dead simple)

## Architecture Decisions

### 1. Iframe-Based Story Viewer (DECIDED 2025-11-09) ✅

**Question:** Should we convert recursive-landing's story viewer to React or use iframe?

**Answer:** Use iframe! Much better for the Vulcan vision.

**Why (Toolmaker Perspective):**
- ✅ **Creators see EXACT final beauty** while editing (WYSIWYG - gods deserve this)
- ✅ Zero conversion effort (vanilla JS → React is 4-6 hours wasted on internal tooling)
- ✅ All features work perfectly: fullscreen, swipe, keyboard, wheel
- ✅ Update viewer once, benefits both forge and public display
- ✅ Less code to maintain = more time for art/activism/spirituality
- ✅ 100% reliable vs 10-20% chance direct copy would work
- ✅ **Non-technical creators** (parents) see their creation come alive immediately

**Solution:**
- **recursive-creator**: The forge - simple upload tool with embedded iframe preview
- **recursive-landing**: The gallery - beautiful viewer where all stories live publicly
- **Communication**: URL params (`?story_id=123&preview=true`)
- **Philosophy**: Separate creation tool (utilitarian) from display (artistic)

### 2. Story Viewer Architecture

**Upload Tool (recursive-creator/dashboard/stories/new):**
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Story Upload Form                   │
│ - Title                            │
│ - Subtitle                         │
│ - Upload images (drag & drop)      │
│ - Reorder pages                    │
│                                    │
│ [Save Draft] [Preview] [Publish]   │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘

When clicking [Preview]:
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│ LIVE PREVIEW (iframe)               │
│ ┌─────────────────────────────────┐ │
│ │ https://recursive.eco/pages/    │ │
│ │ stories/viewer.html              │ │
│ │ ?story_id=123&preview=true       │ │
│ │                                 │ │
│ │ [Story loads from Supabase]     │ │
│ └─────────────────────────────────┘ │
│                                    │
│ ← Back to Edit    [Publish Now]    │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Viewer (recursive-landing/pages/stories/viewer.html):**
```javascript
// Support both local files AND Supabase
const storyId = urlParams.get('story_id');  // NEW: Supabase ID
const storySlug = urlParams.get('story');   // Existing: local file
const isPreview = urlParams.get('preview'); // NEW: draft mode

if (storyId) {
  // Fetch from Supabase
  const { data } = await supabase
    .from('stories')
    .select('*, story_pages(*)')
    .eq('id', storyId);

  // If preview mode, check user owns it
  if (isPreview) {
    // Verify current user is owner
  }
} else if (storySlug) {
  // Existing: fetch local JSON
  const response = await fetch(`${storySlug}/story.json`);
}
```

### 3. Unified Content Viewer Architecture (DECIDED 2025-11-11) ✅

**Question:** Should stories and playlists have separate viewers, or one unified viewer?

**Answer:** Unified viewer! Both are just sequences of content.

**Why (Toolmaker Perspective):**
- ✅ **Same essence**: Stories = image sequences, Playlists = video sequences
- ✅ **Future-proof**: Can mix images + videos in same sequence later
- ✅ **One codebase**: Update viewer once, benefits all content types
- ✅ **Consistent UX**: Users learn one interface, works for everything
- ✅ **Mobile-optimized**: Responsive design for both images and videos
- ✅ **Solves CORS**: Iframe loads from recursive.eco domain (not creator.recursive.eco)

**Solution:**
- **recursive-landing dev branch**: Build unified content viewer at `dev.recursive.eco`
- **Viewer features**: Fullscreen, swipe, keyboard nav, wheel scroll (existing)
- **Video support**: YouTube nocookie embeds (rel=0, modestbranding=1)
- **Supabase integration**: Fetch content via `?id=uuid&type=story|playlist`
- **Clean YouTube UX**: Hide recommendations, no search, bounded experience

**Data Structure (Keep Separate for MVP):**
```json
{
  "document_type": "story" | "playlist",
  "document_data": {
    "pages": [...],    // For stories
    "videos": [...]    // For playlists
  }
}
```

**Future Enhancement (Unified Items Array):**
```json
{
  "document_type": "sequence",
  "document_data": {
    "items": [
      { "type": "image", "image_url": "...", "text": "..." },
      { "type": "video", "video_id": "...", "title": "..." },
      { "type": "image", "image_url": "...", "text": "..." }
    ]
  }
}
```

**Development Workflow:**
1. Create `dev-unified-viewer` branch in recursive-landing
2. Copy `pages/stories/viewer.html` → `pages/content/viewer.html`
3. Add video support + Supabase client
4. Deploy dev branch to `dev.recursive.eco`
5. Update recursive-creator preview iframes to point to dev viewer
6. Test Drive/Imgur images + YouTube videos
7. Merge to main when stable

**YouTube Wrapper Benefits:**
1. 🎭 **Narrative Context** - Add story pages between videos
2. 🧹 **Clean Embeds** - No related videos at end (youtube-nocookie.com)
3. 🛡️ **Safer for Kids** - Can't navigate to random YouTube content
4. 💬 **Community Reviews** - Trusted recommendations (future)

### 4. Design Philosophy: Forges for Mortals

**The Vulcan Principle:** Tools must be simple enough for non-technical creators to wield.

**Design Constraints for All Forges:**
- ✅ **< 10 minutes** to create something meaningful
- ✅ **No technical jargon** - labels a parent understands
- ✅ **Immediate preview** - see beauty come alive
- ✅ **Forgiving UX** - mistakes are easy to fix
- ✅ **Optional complexity** - advanced features hidden until needed
- ✅ **Mobile-friendly** - create on phone while kids nap
- ✅ **Inspiring** - using the tool feels playful, not bureaucratic

**Anti-patterns to Avoid:**
- ❌ Dev-focused UI (no "deploy," use "publish")
- ❌ Multi-step wizards (everything on one screen if possible)
- ❌ Hidden features (preview always visible)
- ❌ Overwhelming options (start simple, add complexity later)
- ❌ Ugly internal tools (even forges deserve beauty)

**The Test:**
Could a parent who's never coded before create a story for their child in under 10 minutes, while feeling inspired rather than frustrated?

If no → simplify the forge.

### 4. Visibility & Access (Donations-Only Philosophy)

**Requirement:** Gateway building, not gatekeeping

**Solution:**
- Visibility in story_data JSONB: `"visibility": "public"` or `"private"`
- NO paywalls - all published stories accessible to everyone
- Optional donation prompts (gentle, not pushy)
- Creators own their content
- Preview mode for drafts (creator sees before publishing)
- RLS policies enforce creator-only editing, public viewing

### 3. Auth Portability

**Requirement:** Copy auth to channels and journal projects

**Solution:**
- All projects share same Supabase instance
- Copy 4 files, update Supabase email template once
- Works across all projects in ~50 minutes
- See: `AUTH_PORTABILITY.md`

## Technical Context

### Supabase Connection

**Project:** Shared across all Recursive.eco apps
**URL:** https://yoursrpohfbpxoalyoeg.supabase.co (check .env)

**Existing Tables:**
- `channels` - Wellness/creative/learning channels
- `tools` - Community tools (JSONB-heavy, keep as-is)
- `profiles` - User profiles (JSONB-heavy, keep as-is)
- `journal_templates` - Journaling prompts
- `user_documents` - Generic user data (JSONB-heavy, keep as-is)
- `newsletter_subscribers` - Email signups

**New Tables (To Create for Phase 1):**

Using **JSONB-heavy approach** for simplicity (see SIMPLE_JSONB_SCHEMA.md):

```sql
-- Stories (everything in JSONB)
CREATE TABLE stories (
  id uuid PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
  slug text UNIQUE NOT NULL,
  story_data jsonb DEFAULT '{}'::jsonb,
  created_at timestamptz DEFAULT now()
);

CREATE INDEX idx_stories_creator ON stories ((story_data->>'creator_id'));
CREATE INDEX idx_stories_visibility ON stories ((story_data->>'visibility'));

-- Story pages (minimal structure)
CREATE TABLE story_pages (
  id uuid PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
  story_id uuid REFERENCES stories(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  page_number integer NOT NULL,
  page_data jsonb DEFAULT '{}'::jsonb,
  created_at timestamptz DEFAULT now(),
  UNIQUE(story_id, page_number)
);

-- RLS Policies
ALTER TABLE stories ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE story_pages ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

CREATE POLICY "Anyone can view public published stories"
  ON stories FOR SELECT
  USING (
    story_data->>'visibility' = 'public'
    AND story_data->>'published' = 'true'
  );

CREATE POLICY "Users can view their own stories"
  ON stories FOR SELECT
  USING (story_data->>'creator_id' = auth.uid()::text);

CREATE POLICY "Users can create stories"
  ON stories FOR INSERT
  WITH CHECK (story_data->>'creator_id' = auth.uid()::text);

CREATE POLICY "Users can update their own stories"
  ON stories FOR UPDATE
  USING (story_data->>'creator_id' = auth.uid()::text);

CREATE POLICY "Users can delete their own stories"
  ON stories FOR DELETE
  USING (story_data->>'creator_id' = auth.uid()::text);

CREATE POLICY "Story pages visible to story viewers"
  ON story_pages FOR SELECT
  USING (
    EXISTS (
      SELECT 1 FROM stories
      WHERE stories.id = story_pages.story_id
      AND (
        (story_data->>'visibility' = 'public' AND story_data->>'published' = 'true')
        OR story_data->>'creator_id' = auth.uid()::text
      )
    )
  );

CREATE POLICY "Users can manage their story pages"
  ON story_pages FOR ALL
  USING (
    EXISTS (
      SELECT 1 FROM stories
      WHERE stories.id = story_pages.story_id
      AND story_data->>'creator_id' = auth.uid()::text
    )
  );

-- Storage bucket for story images
INSERT INTO storage.buckets (id, name, public)
VALUES ('story-images', 'story-images', true)
ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING;
```

**story_data structure:**
```json
{
  "title": "The Nest Knows Best",
  "subtitle": "For Little Ones Learning to Sleep",
  "author": "PlayfulProcess",
  "cover_image_url": "story-images/user-id/story-id/cover.png",
  "visibility": "private",
  "published": false,
  "creator_id": "user-uuid-here"
}
```

**page_data structure:**
```json
{
  "image_url": "story-images/user-id/story-id/page-1.png",
  "alt_text": "Bunny sitting under a tree",
  "narration": "Once upon a time..."
}
```

**Future Tables (Phase 2):**
- `playlists` table (same JSONB approach)

**Schema Location:** See `SIMPLE_JSONB_SCHEMA.md` for complete copy-paste ready schema

### Auth Setup

**Current Status:** ✅ Dual auth implemented + bugs fixed

**Implementation Complete:**
1. ✅ `DualAuth.tsx` component (two-step flow: email → OTP)
2. ✅ Auth callback route (`app/auth/callback/route.ts`)
3. ✅ Error page with OTP fallback (`app/auth/error/page.tsx`)
4. ✅ **CRITICAL BUG FIXED:** Cookie domain configuration

**Remaining:**
1. ⏳ Update Supabase email template (include `{{ .Token }}`)
2. ⏳ Test across email providers and environments

## Session 3-4 Updates: Auth Debugging Journey

### Bug #1: Cookie Domain Configuration (Fixed - Best Practice)

**Initial Problem:**
Hardcoded `domain: '.recursive.eco'` doesn't work on localhost or Vercel previews.

**Solution:**
Environment-aware cookie configuration:
```typescript
const isProduction = hostname.endsWith('recursive.eco');
const cookieDomain = isProduction ? '.recursive.eco' : undefined;
```

**Files:** `lib/supabase-client.ts`, `lib/supabase-server.ts`

### Bug #2: CRITICAL - Wrong Callback Logic (ACTUAL ROOT CAUSE)

**The Real Problem (discovered via Vercel logs):**
```
❌ Missing token_hash or type in callback
fullUrl: 'https://creator.recursive.eco/auth/callback?code=af540734-95db-4ab9-ba31-3283f66cc36e'
```

Supabase was sending a `code` parameter (PKCE flow), but the callback was ONLY looking for `token_hash` + `type`.

**Why This Happened:**
- I wrote callback logic from scratch instead of copying from recursive-channels-fresh
- recursive-channels-fresh handles BOTH flows (old magic link + new PKCE)
- I only implemented the old flow

**Solution:**
Copied EXACT callback logic from recursive-channels-fresh:

```typescript
// Handle magic link tokens (old flow)
if (token_hash && type === 'magiclink') {
  await supabase.auth.verifyOtp({ token_hash, type: 'magiclink' })
}

// Handle PKCE code exchange (new flow) ← THIS WAS MISSING!
if (code) {
  await supabase.auth.exchangeCodeForSession(code)
}
```

**File:** `app/auth/callback/route.ts`

**Key Lesson:** ALWAYS copy working code from recursive-channels-fresh as the reference implementation!

### Dark Mode Implementation

**All auth pages converted to dark theme:**
- `app/page.tsx` - Main landing page (bg-gray-900)
- `components/auth/DualAuth.tsx` - Auth form (bg-gray-800 cards)
- `app/auth/error/page.tsx` - Error page (dark theme + OTP input)

**Design choices:**
- Background: `bg-gray-900` (main page), `bg-gray-800` (cards)
- Text: `text-white` (headings), `text-gray-400` (body)
- Inputs: `bg-gray-700` with `border-gray-600`
- Success/Error messages: Semi-transparent backgrounds with colored borders
- Buttons: Blue primary (`bg-blue-600`) for consistency

### OTP Fallback on Error Page

**New functionality added to `/auth/error`:**
- Initial view shows error message + "Enter 6-Digit Code" button
- Clicking button reveals full OTP verification form
- Form includes email input + OTP input (6 digits)
- Successfully verifies and logs user in if OTP is valid
- Provides fallback if magic link fails

**User flow:**
1. Magic link fails → redirected to `/auth/error`
2. User sees error explanation + OTP option
3. User clicks "Enter 6-Digit Code"
4. User enters email + 6-digit code from email
5. System verifies OTP → redirects to dashboard

**File:** `app/auth/error/page.tsx` - Now client component with state management

---

## Session 5 Updates: Corporate Email & Supabase Configuration

### The Final Auth Issue: 403 Forbidden on OTP Verification

**Problem:** After implementing dual auth, Gmail worked perfectly but corporate email (Pepsico/Outlook) failed with:
```
POST https://evixjvagwjmjdjpbazuj.supabase.co/auth/v1/verify 403 (Forbidden)
```

### Discovery Process:

**Initial Theory: Outlook SafeLinks Breaking Auth**
- Corporate emails wrap links in SafeLinks: `https://nam12.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=...`
- This breaks PKCE flow because code_verifier cookie gets lost through the redirect chain
- ✅ This explained why magic links failed
- ❌ But didn't explain why OTP also failed (OTP bypasses callbacks entirely!)

**Key Insight: Testing on Multiple Devices**
- Tried OTP on corporate computer → 403 error
- Tried OTP on personal computer → **SAME 403 error!**
- This ruled out corporate firewall/security as the cause

**The Root Cause: Supabase "Confirm Email" Setting**

When "Confirm Email" is ENABLED in Supabase:
1. **First-time users** get "Confirm your signup" email (NO OTP code)
2. Must click confirmation link to activate account
3. **Only then** can use OTP for future logins
4. If user exists but is UNCONFIRMED → OTP returns 403 Forbidden

**What Was Happening:**
- Gmail user: Already confirmed (from earlier testing) → OTP worked ✅
- Pepsico user: Created while email confirmation was ON → stuck in unconfirmed state → OTP failed ❌

### The Solution:

**Step 1: Disable Email Confirmation**
- Go to Supabase Dashboard → Authentication → Providers → Email
- Set **"Enable email confirmation"** to **OFF**
- Rationale: OTP already verifies email ownership, no need for separate confirmation

**Step 2: Delete & Recreate Unconfirmed Users**
- Users created BEFORE disabling confirmation are stuck with `email_confirmed_at: null`
- Must delete these users from Supabase Dashboard → Authentication → Users
- User signs up again → now works immediately with OTP

### Critical Supabase Configuration for Dual Auth:

**Authentication → Providers → Email:**
- ✅ Enable email provider: **ON**
- ✅ Confirm email: **OFF** (critical for OTP-only flow)

**Authentication → URL Configuration:**
- Site URL: `https://creator.recursive.eco`
- Redirect URLs:
  - `https://creator.recursive.eco/auth/callback`
  - `https://*.vercel.app/auth/callback`
  - `http://localhost:3001/auth/callback`

**Email Templates → Magic Link:**
Must include BOTH magic link AND OTP code:
```html
<h2>Sign in to Recursive.eco</h2>
<p><strong>Option 1: Click to sign in</strong></p>
<p><a href="{{ .ConfirmationURL }}">Sign in to Recursive.eco</a></p>

<p><strong>Option 2: Enter this code</strong></p>
<p style="font-size: 32px; font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: 8px; font-family: monospace;">
  {{ .Token }}
</p>
```

### Why Corporate Email Still Works with OTP:

**Magic Link Flow (Broken by SafeLinks):**
1. Supabase generates: `https://supabase.co/auth/v1/verify?token=pkce_...&redirect_to=creator.recursive.eco`
2. Outlook wraps it: `https://safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=...`
3. User clicks → goes through Outlook's server first
4. PKCE code_verifier cookie lost in redirect chain
5. Callback receives code but no verifier → fails ❌

**OTP Flow (Works Perfectly):**
1. User receives 6-digit code in email
2. Types code directly in browser (on creator.recursive.eco)
3. Browser → Supabase API directly (no redirects, no callbacks, no cookies needed)
4. Supabase verifies code → creates session → success ✅

### Debugging Added (Console Logs):

Added comprehensive logging to help diagnose OTP issues:

```typescript
console.log('🔢 Attempting OTP verification:', { email, otpLength, otpValue })
console.log('🔢 OTP verification response:', { success, error, hasSession })
```

**Files updated:**
- `components/auth/DualAuth.tsx` - OTP verification with logging
- `app/auth/error/page.tsx` - Error page OTP with logging

### Testing Status:

✅ **Gmail** - Magic link + OTP both work
✅ **Corporate Email (Outlook/Pepsico)** - OTP works (magic link expected to fail)
✅ **Dark mode** implemented across all auth pages
✅ **Auto-prefilled email** on error page via sessionStorage
✅ **PKCE + Magic Link** flows both supported in callback

### Key Lessons Learned:

1. **Supabase email confirmation MUST be disabled for OTP-only flows**
2. **Corporate email SafeLinks break magic links** - OTP is the solution
3. **403 errors often mean "user not confirmed"** not "wrong credentials"
4. **Always check Supabase Dashboard → Users** to see confirmation status
5. **Vercel logs show server-side (callbacks)**, **Browser console shows client-side (OTP)**

## Quick Start (Resuming Development)

### If Starting Fresh Session:

**Step 1: Read Context (5 min)**
- Read this file (CLAUDE.md)
- Skim PROJECT_PLAN.md
- Check "Current State" section above

**Step 2: Check Phase**
- Look at "Current State" → what's done, what's next
- If Phase 0 (auth): Read AUTH_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md
- If Phase 1+ (features): Read PROJECT_PLAN.md

**Step 3: Ask User**
- "Ready to continue with [current task]?"
- Confirm any decisions if unclear

**Step 4: Continue**
- Pick up where we left off
- Use TodoWrite to track progress
- Update this file when major decisions are made

### If User Says "Continue" or "Let's go":
- Check "Next Steps" in "Current State" section
- Start with first unchecked task
- Create todos with TodoWrite
- Begin implementation

---

## Important Notes


### Always Do:
- ✅ Use TodoWrite for multi-step tasks
- ✅ Mark todos complete as you finish
- ✅ Copy proven patterns (don't reinvent)
- ✅ Test across email providers (Gmail, Outlook, etc.)
- ✅ Ask for clarification if ambiguous

### Code Style:
- TypeScript (strict mode)
- Tailwind CSS (utility-first)
- Server components by default (use 'use client' when needed)
- Descriptive variable names
- Comments for complex logic

---

## Debugging Tips

### If Auth Issues:

**1. Check Vercel Logs FIRST!**
- Go to Vercel Dashboard → Project → Logs → Real-time
- Look for auth callback logs with 🔐 emoji
- Check what parameters Supabase is sending: `code`, `token_hash`, or `type`?
- This tells you which flow Supabase is using

**2. Common Auth Failures:**

**"Missing token_hash or type"** → Callback not handling PKCE flow
- Supabase sends `code` parameter (PKCE)
- Callback needs `exchangeCodeForSession(code)`
- Solution: Copy callback from recursive-channels-fresh

**"Token has expired or is invalid"** → Multiple possible causes
- Check Vercel logs for actual error
- Could be expired link (1 hour timeout)
- Could be wrong redirect URL in Supabase
- Could be cookie domain issues

**"Code exchange failed"** → Redirect URL mismatch
- Check Supabase Dashboard → Authentication → URL Configuration
- Ensure callback URLs are whitelisted for your domain
- Need: `https://creator.recursive.eco/auth/callback`

**3. Cookie Domain Check:**
- Browser dev tools → Application → Cookies
- localhost should have NO domain attribute
- production should have `domain=.recursive.eco`
- Look for cookies like `sb-*-auth-token`

**4. Test Both Auth Methods:**
- Click magic link (should redirect to /dashboard)
- If that fails, use OTP on error page
- OTP bypasses the callback flow entirely

### If Database Issues:
- Check RLS policies (common source of "no rows" errors)
- Verify foreign keys exist
- Look at Supabase logs in dashboard
- Test queries in SQL Editor

### If Build Issues:
- Check Next.js version (15.4.3)
- Verify all imports
- Check middleware.ts path config
- Clear .next folder and rebuild

## Current Session Context (Session 11 - Phase 7 Implementation & Deployment)

**Date:** 2025-11-13
**Focus:** Implement Drive folder batch upload, deploy to Vercel, fix bugs

### What We Accomplished:

**Phase 7: Drive Folder Import** ✅ COMPLETE
- Created backend API route `/api/import-drive-folder`
- Uses Google Drive API v3 with API key (no OAuth needed!)
- Filters for images and videos, sorts alphabetically by filename
- Frontend: Added "📁 Import Folder" button + modal
- Auto-populates bulk textarea with imported URLs
- Works with publicly shared Drive folders
- **Implementation time:** ~2 hours (as estimated)

**Deployment to Vercel** ✅
- Merged dev → main, force pushed to trigger deployment
- Fixed old commit issue (was deploying 58 commits behind!)
- Domain configuration verified (creator.recursive.eco)
- Deployed commit: b7e2aff
- **Status:** Live and working in production!

**Bug Fixes Based on User Feedback** ✅
1. **Save button:** Added better error validation and logging
2. **Alphabetical sorting:** Imported files now sorted by filename
3. **CSP errors:** Documented as expected (Google Drive security)

**Testing Results:**
- ✅ Drive folder import working
- ✅ Alphabetical sorting working
- ✅ Save button working
- ✅ All features tested and confirmed by user

**Key Files:**
- `/app/api/import-drive-folder/route.ts` - Backend API (133 lines)
- `/app/dashboard/sequences/new/page.tsx` - Frontend UI updates
- **Commits:** 03a95a6 (Phase 7), d6e0dd3 (trigger deploy), b7e2aff (bug fixes)

**Environment Variables Needed:**
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
- `GOOGLE_DRIVE_API_KEY` (new!)

**Lessons Learned:**
- Vercel can deploy old commits if not monitored carefully
- Public Drive folders don't require OAuth (huge simplification!)
- Force redeploy: empty commit or Vercel dashboard
- CSP errors for Google Drive framing are expected and normal

## Previous Session Context (Session 10 - Phase 6 Cleanup & Drive Folder Research)

**Date:** 2025-11-13
**Focus:** Clean up unused stories/playlists code, research Gmail/Drive folder batch upload feature

### What We Completed:

**Phase 6 Cleanup** ✅
- Removed all unused stories and playlists code from dashboard
- Deleted `/dashboard/stories/new/page.tsx` (replaced by sequences)
- Deleted `/dashboard/playlists/new/page.tsx` (replaced by sequences)
- Removed Story and Playlist TypeScript interfaces
- Removed stories/playlists state variables and fetch functions
- Removed dashboard JSX sections for stories and playlists
- Updated `getStatusBadge()` to use Sequence type
- **Result:** Dashboard now shows only "My Projects" (sequences section)
- **Removed:** 1,150 lines of unused code
- **Build:** Tested and passing ✅
- **Committed:** 47e220a - "Phase 6 cleanup: Remove unused stories and playlists code"

**Drive Folder Batch Upload Research** ✅
- Researched Google Drive API v3 for folder file listing
- **Key Finding:** Public folders DON'T require OAuth! (Can use API key only)
- **Implementation Estimate:** 2-3 hours (not 2-3 days as initially thought)
- **Documented in:** PROJECT_PLAN.md Phase 7
- **User Need:** Currently tedious to add 10+ images (must share each file individually)
- **Solution:** Paste ONE folder link, app extracts all file URLs automatically

**Technical Approach Documented:**
- Backend API route: `/api/import-drive-folder`
- Google Drive API v3 with API key (read-only)
- Filter files by mimeType (images + videos)
- Convert to direct URLs (Drive format: `uc?export=view&id=FILE_ID`)
- Auto-populate bulk textarea for review before import
- **Limitation:** Only works with publicly shared folders
- **Priority:** Medium (nice-to-have, not critical)

**Next Steps:**
- Phase 6 testing on Vercel (user tests)
- Optionally implement Phase 7 (Drive folder import) if desired

## Previous Session Context (Session 9 - Unified Sequence Creator Implementation)

**Date:** 2025-11-12
**Focus:** Build unified sequence creator (mix images + videos), mobile-first viewer, NO database changes

**Major Accomplishment:** Completed Phases 1-4 of unified sequence creator!

### What We Built:

**Phase 1: Backend (NO DB CHANGES!)** ✅
- Use existing `document_type: 'creative_work'` (already in database)
- Identify sequences with `tool_slug: 'sequence'`
- Zero migrations needed - works with existing schema!

**Phase 2: Unified Creator UI** ✅
- Created `/dashboard/sequences/new` - mix images AND videos
- **Dropdown menu:** Add Image or Add Video
- Type-specific inputs (alt text for images, title for videos)
- Auto-convert Drive URLs → `uc?export=view&id=FILE_ID` format ✅ (user confirmed working!)
- Auto-extract YouTube video IDs from any URL format
- Reorder items with up/down arrows
- Live thumbnails for both types
- Proxy wrapping for CORS on Drive images

**Phase 3: Mobile-First React Viewer** ✅
- Created `/components/viewers/SequenceViewer.tsx`
- **Design principle:** "If you can swipe through it like Instagram stories, it's simple enough"
- Primary interaction: **Swipe left/right** (mobile)
- Secondary: Keyboard arrows (desktop)
- Large touch targets (56px buttons) - avoid hamburger menu issues
- Minimal UI: page counter + fullscreen button at bottom
- No complex overlays or menus in viewer
- YouTube nocookie embeds with clean UI (`rel=0`, `modestbranding=1`)
- Site header/navigation unchanged (hamburger stays for site nav)

**Phase 4: Dashboard Integration** ✅
- Added "My Sequences" section to dashboard (top, green highlight)
- Fetch sequences: `tool_slug='sequence'` + `document_type='creative_work'`
- Create/Edit/Delete functionality
- Shows item count, date, status badges
- Old stories/playlists sections still exist (safety net for Phase 6 testing)

**Key Technical Decisions:**
1. **NO database changes** - use existing creative_work type
2. **Mobile-first viewer** - gestures > buttons, avoid touch issues
3. **Test before cleanup** - keep old tools until sequences proven working
4. **Drive format that works:** `https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=FILE_ID`

**Drive URL Fix (Session 9 start):**
- Reset to bc6a9f9, then updated to use `uc?export=view` format
- Removed Imgur references (focus on Drive)
- User confirmed: "The google links are working!"

**Current State:**
- **Phases 1-4:** Complete and pushed to dev
- **Phase 5:** Pending - cleanup old story/playlist files
- **Phase 6:** Pending - testing on Vercel
- **Strategy:** Test first, cleanup after (safety net approach)

**Files Created:**
- `/app/dashboard/sequences/new/page.tsx` - Unified creator (562 lines)
- `/components/viewers/SequenceViewer.tsx` - Mobile-first viewer (229 lines)

**Files Modified:**
- `/app/dashboard/page.tsx` - Added sequences section
- `/app/api/proxy-image/route.ts` - Removed Imgur, kept Drive
- `/PROJECT_PLAN.md` - Documented full plan with 6 phases

**Next Steps (Phase 6 Testing):**
1. ✅ Commit and push to dev
2. ✅ Update CLAUDE.md
3. ⏳ User tests on Vercel
4. ⏳ Verify Drive images load through proxy
5. ⏳ Verify YouTube embeds work
6. ⏳ Test mobile swipe navigation
7. ⏳ If all good → Phase 5 cleanup (remove old files)
8. ⏳ If issues → debug with safety net (old code still exists)

## Previous Session Context (Session 8 - Unified Viewer Architecture)

**Date:** 2025-11-11
**Focus:** Pivot from Supabase Storage to URL-based approach, build YouTube playlist creator, plan unified viewer

**Previous Session Summary (Session 7):**
- ✅ Built story/playlist upload forges with URL-based storage (no file uploads!)
- ✅ Added Google Drive URL auto-conversion
- ✅ Created YouTube playlist wrapper with video embeds
- ✅ Added 'playlist' to document_types (migration 002-add-playlist-type.sql)
- ✅ Dashboard shows both stories and playlists

**Session 8 Accomplishments:**
- ✅ **PIVOTED from Supabase Storage to URL-based approach** (Session 7)
  - Users provide image URLs (Google Drive, Imgur, etc.)
  - No hosting costs, users own their data
  - Auto-converts Drive sharing links to direct image URLs
- ✅ **Built YouTube playlist creator** (`/dashboard/playlists/new`) (Session 7)
  - Auto-extracts video IDs from any YouTube URL format
  - YouTube nocookie embeds (privacy-enhanced)
  - Same approval workflow as stories
- ✅ **Auto-show preview after saving** (Session 8)
  - Preview automatically appears with `setShowPreview(true)`
  - WYSIWYG experience for creators
- ✅ **Investigated image rendering issues** (Session 8)
  - No old Supabase Storage code found (completely URL-based)
  - CORS issues with Drive/Imgur likely cause of rendering failures
  - Iframe approach should solve this
- ✅ **UNIFIED VIEWER ARCHITECTURE DECIDED** (Session 8)
  - Stories + playlists merge into one content viewer
  - Both are just "sequences of content" (images vs videos)
  - Build in recursive-landing dev branch, iframe from creator
- ✅ **Built unified content viewer** (`recursive-landing/pages/content/viewer.html`)
  - Supports both Supabase (`?id=uuid&type=story|playlist`) and local JSON (`?story=slug`)
  - Auto-detects content type: renders images OR videos
  - YouTube nocookie embeds with `rel=0`, `modestbranding=1`
  - All existing features: fullscreen, swipe, keyboard, wheel navigation
  - 480 lines of vanilla JS with Supabase client integration
- ✅ **Updated recursive-creator preview iframes**
  - Story preview: Points to `dev.recursive.eco/pages/content/viewer.html?id={id}&type=story`
  - Playlist preview: Points to `dev.recursive.eco/pages/content/viewer.html?id={id}&type=playlist`
  - Replaced ~105 lines of inline preview code with ~12 lines of iframe
  - Cleaner codebase, single source of truth for rendering
- ✅ **Deployed dev branch to dev.recursive.eco**
  - Dev branch `dev-unified-viewer` created and pushed
  - Production stays stable on main branch
  - Ready for testing

**Key Insight:**
Both stories and playlists are **sequences of content**. Instead of separate viewers:
- One unified viewer handles images AND videos
- YouTube wrapper provides: narrative context, clean embeds, safer UX, community reviews
- Future: Mix images + videos in same sequence (story page → video → story page)

**YouTube Wrapper Value Proposition:**
1. 🎭 **Narrative Context** - Add story pages before/after videos as "chapters"
2. 🧹 **Clean YouTube Embeds** - Hide related videos (youtube-nocookie.com, rel=0)
3. 🛡️ **Safer for Kids** - Bounded experience, can't navigate away
4. 💬 **Community Reviews** - Trusted recommendations (future)

**Session 8 Testing Instructions (PLEASE TEST!):**

The unified viewer architecture is complete and deployed to `dev.recursive.eco`. Here's what to test:

**Test 1: Story Creation with Drive/Imgur Images**
1. Go to `creator.recursive.eco/dashboard/stories/new`
2. Create a new story with:
   - Title: "Test Story"
   - Subtitle: "Testing Drive/Imgur images"
   - Author: Your name
3. Add pages with image URLs from:
   - Google Drive (sharing link format)
   - Imgur (direct link)
   - Any other image hosting service
4. Click "Save New Draft"
5. **Check:** Does the preview automatically appear? ✅/❌
6. **Check:** Do the images render correctly in the preview iframe? ✅/❌
7. **Check:** Can you navigate between pages (swipe, arrows, keyboard)? ✅/❌
8. **Check:** Does fullscreen mode work? ✅/❌

**Test 2: Playlist Creation with YouTube Videos**
1. Go to `creator.recursive.eco/dashboard/playlists/new`
2. Create a new playlist with:
   - Title: "Test Playlist"
   - Description: "Testing YouTube embeds"
   - Category: "Kids"
3. Add videos with various YouTube URL formats:
   - `https://youtube.com/watch?v=VIDEO_ID`
   - `https://youtu.be/VIDEO_ID`
   - Direct video ID: `VIDEO_ID`
4. Click "Save Playlist"
5. **Check:** Does the preview automatically appear? ✅/❌
6. **Check:** Do the videos embed correctly? ✅/❌
7. **Check:** Are related videos hidden (clean YouTube UX)? ✅/❌
8. **Check:** Can you navigate between videos? ✅/❌

**Test 3: CORS Issue Resolution**
1. Use a Google Drive image that previously failed to render
2. Create a story with that image
3. **Check:** Does it render in the iframe preview? ✅/❌
4. **Expected:** Iframe should solve CORS issues (if not, we'll need proxy)

**Test 4: Navigation & UX**
1. In both story and playlist previews:
2. **Check:** Swipe left/right works on mobile? ✅/❌
3. **Check:** Keyboard arrow keys work? ✅/❌
4. **Check:** Mouse wheel scrolling works? ✅/❌
5. **Check:** Fullscreen button works? ✅/❌
6. **Check:** Page counter shows correctly? ✅/❌

**Expected Results:**
- ✅ Preview auto-shows after saving
- ✅ Drive/Imgur images render (CORS solved by iframe)
- ✅ YouTube videos embed cleanly (no related videos)
- ✅ All navigation methods work (swipe, keyboard, wheel)
- ✅ Fullscreen mode works
- ✅ Mobile-responsive design

**If Issues Found:**
1. Take screenshots of errors
2. Check browser console for error messages
3. Note which specific images/videos fail
4. We'll debug together in next session

**Next Steps After Testing:**
1. If all tests pass → Merge dev branch to main in recursive-landing
2. Update iframe URLs in recursive-creator to point to main (recursive.eco)
3. Deploy to production
4. Move to Phase 2: Admin dashboard for story approval

**Current Files:**
- ✅ `app/dashboard/stories/new/page.tsx` - URL-based story creator
- ✅ `app/dashboard/playlists/new/page.tsx` - YouTube playlist creator
- ✅ `app/dashboard/page.tsx` - Dashboard with both stories and playlists
- ✅ `supabase/migrations/002-add-playlist-type.sql` - Playlist document type
- ⏳ `recursive-landing/pages/content/viewer.html` - To be created in dev branch

**Supabase Email Template (Magic Link + OTP):**

Go to: Supabase Dashboard → Authentication → Email Templates → Magic Link

```html
<h2>Sign in to Recursive.eco</h2>

<p>Click the link below to sign in:</p>
<p><a href="{{ .ConfirmationURL }}">Sign In</a></p>

<p><strong>Or enter this 6-digit code:</strong></p>
<p style="font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold; font-family: monospace;">{{ .Token }}</p>

<p style="font-size: 12px; color: #666;">
  This code expires in 1 hour.<br>
  If you didn't request this, you can safely ignore it.
</p>
```

**Key:** The `{{ .Token }}` variable includes the 6-digit OTP code

**Redirect URLs to Whitelist in Supabase:**
- Local: `http://localhost:3001/auth/callback`
- Preview: `https://*.vercel.app/auth/callback`
- Production: `https://creator.recursive.eco/auth/callback`

**Current Development Server:**
- Running on port 3001 (port 3000 was in use)
- Access at: http://localhost:3001
- Ready for testing with updated email template

---

## Questions to Ask User (If Resuming and Unclear)

1. "What phase are we on?" (Check Current State)
2. "Should I continue with [next task]?" (Check Next Steps)
3. "Any decisions changed since last session?" (Validate context)
4. "Ready to start implementation?" (Get confirmation)

**If user says "continue," "let's go," or similar:**
→ Check Next Steps, create todos, start work!

## Quick Reference: What Changed in Sessions 3-4

### Files Modified:
1. `lib/supabase-client.ts` - Environment-aware cookie domain (best practice)
2. `lib/supabase-server.ts` - Environment-aware cookie domain (best practice)
3. `app/page.tsx` - Dark mode (bg-gray-900)
4. `components/auth/DualAuth.tsx` - Dark mode + sessionStorage for email
5. `app/auth/error/page.tsx` - Dark mode + OTP form + auto-prefilled email
6. `app/auth/callback/route.ts` - **CRITICAL FIX:** Now handles PKCE code exchange

### Critical Bug Fixed:
**Missing PKCE Code Handler** - Supabase sends `code` parameter (PKCE flow), but callback only handled `token_hash` + `type` (old magic link flow). Fixed by copying EXACT callback logic from recursive-channels-fresh which handles BOTH flows.

### How We Found It:
Vercel logs showed:
```
fullUrl: '...?code=af540734-95db-4ab9-ba31-3283f66cc36e'
❌ Missing token_hash or type in callback
```

This revealed callback was ignoring the `code` parameter completely.

### Features Added:
1. **Dark mode** across all auth pages
2. **OTP fallback** with sessionStorage email prefill
3. **Environment-aware cookies** (localhost, Vercel, production)
4. **PKCE code exchange** support (the missing piece!)

### Testing Status:
- ✅ All code matches working recursive-channels-fresh
- ✅ Supabase email template includes `{{ .Token }}`
- ⏳ Awaiting production test (should work now!)

### Next Session:
- Test auth on https://creator.recursive.eco/
- If working, copy improvements to other projects
- Start Phase 1 (story publisher features)

## Phase 8: Publishing Workflow & Licensing (NEXT)

**Date:** 2025-11-19
**Status:** Planning
**Goal:** Implement clear publishing workflow with licensing, terms, and channel submission

**Dev Branch Name:** `feature/publishing-workflow-20251119` (across all repos)

---

### Overview: Gateway Building with Clear Legal Framework

Before opening to community, we need:
1. ✅ Clear licensing for user-generated content
2. ✅ Terms of use that protect the platform
3. ✅ Smooth workflow from create → publish → share to channels
4. ✅ "Recursive.eco links only" policy for channels (quality control + legal clarity)

---

### Phase 8.1: Legal Foundation & Terms (Week 1)

#### **A) Update About Page Terms** (`recursive-landing/pages/about.html`)

**Location:** Add new subsection at line ~520 (after "Your Content & Responsibilities")

**Content:**
```html
<!-- User-Generated Content & Licensing -->
<div class="bg-blue-50 border-l-4 border-blue-400 p-6 mb-6">
    <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-3 flex items-center">
        <span class="mr-2">📖</span>
        Content You Create & Publish
    </h3>
    <p class="text-gray-800 mb-3 leading-relaxed">
        When you publish content on Recursive.eco (stories, curated playlists, or mixed sequences),
        all <strong>original content you create</strong>—images, text, narration—is automatically
        licensed under
        <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
           class="text-blue-600 hover:text-blue-800 underline font-semibold">
            Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International (CC BY-SA 4.0)
        </a>.
    </p>
    <p class="text-gray-800 mb-3 leading-relaxed">
        <strong>What this means:</strong>
    </p>
    <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-800 space-y-1 mb-3">
        <li>✅ Anyone can view, share, and adapt your original content</li>
        <li>✅ They must give you credit (attribution)</li>
        <li>✅ Adaptations must use the same license (share-alike)</li>
        <li>✅ Commercial use is allowed (aligns with Free Software values)</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="text-gray-800 mb-3 leading-relaxed">
        <strong>External content (YouTube videos, etc.):</strong> If you include links to external
        content, those remain under their original creators' terms. You're curating a collection,
        not licensing content you don't own.
    </p>
    <p class="text-gray-800 mb-3 leading-relaxed">
        <strong>Your rights:</strong> You retain copyright to your original work. The CC BY-SA 4.0
        license is a <em>non-exclusive</em> license—you can still use your content elsewhere,
        sell it, or license it differently. You simply can't revoke the public's right to use
        what you've already shared under CC BY-SA 4.0.
    </p>
    <p class="text-gray-800 leading-relaxed">
        <strong>Important:</strong> You represent that you own or have permission to use all content
        you publish. Do not upload copyrighted material without permission. We reserve the right to
        remove content that violates copyright or community standards.
    </p>
</div>
```

**Why this approach:**
- ✅ Generic message works for stories, playlists, AND mixed sequences
- ✅ External link to official CC license (no need to copy full legal text)
- ✅ Clear: "Your stuff = CC BY-SA, External links = not yours"
- ✅ Lives in existing legal section where users expect it

---

#### **B) Add License Checkbox at Publish Time** (`recursive-creator/app/dashboard/sequences/new/page.tsx`)

**Location:** Before "Save & Publish" button (around line 400-500)

**Implementation:**
```tsx
{/* License Agreement - Show before publishing */}
{!isPublished && (
  <div className="bg-purple-50 border border-purple-200 rounded-lg p-6 mb-6">
    <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-3">
      📖 Publishing Your Content
    </h3>
    <p className="text-gray-700 text-sm mb-4">
      When you publish, all <strong>original content you create</strong>
      (images, text, narration) will be licensed under{' '}
      <a
        href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/"
        target="_blank"
        rel="noopener"
        className="text-purple-600 hover:text-purple-700 underline font-semibold"
      >
        Creative Commons BY-SA 4.0
      </a>.
    </p>
    <p className="text-gray-700 text-sm mb-4">
      If you include links to external content (like YouTube videos),
      those remain under their original creators' terms—you're simply
      curating a collection.
    </p>

    <label className="flex items-start gap-3 cursor-pointer">
      <input
        type="checkbox"
        checked={licenseAgreed}
        onChange={(e) => setLicenseAgreed(e.target.checked)}
        className="mt-1 w-5 h-5 text-purple-600 rounded focus:ring-2 focus:ring-purple-500"
      />
      <span className="text-sm text-gray-800">
        I confirm that I own or have permission to use all original content
        in this project, and I agree to license it under CC BY-SA 4.0.
        I have read the{' '}
        <a
          href="https://recursive.eco/pages/about.html#terms"
          target="_blank"
          rel="noopener"
          className="text-purple-600 hover:text-purple-700 underline"
        >
          Terms of Use
        </a>.
      </span>
    </label>
  </div>
)}

{/* Update publish button to require license agreement */}
<button
  onClick={handleSaveDraft}
  disabled={saving || !title || items.length === 0 || !licenseAgreed}
  className="..."
>
  {isPublished ? 'Update Published Content' : 'Save & Publish'}
</button>
```

**Key Features:**
- ✅ Same message for ALL content types (stories, playlists, mixed)
- ✅ Checkbox required to publish (enforced via disabled button)
- ✅ Link to Terms of Use for full details
- ✅ External link to CC BY-SA 4.0 license

**State to add:**
```tsx
const [licenseAgreed, setLicenseAgreed] = useState(false);
```

### Phase 8.2: Submit to Community Button (Week 1) 🔄 IN PROGRESS

**Current Status:** Phase 8.2 submit button exists but has issues that need fixing

**Issues Found (2025-11-21):**

1. **Pre-fill Modal Not Opening**
   - Submit button redirects to channels.recursive.eco with query params
   - Modal in channels app is not opening/pre-filling with the data
   - URL format: `https://channels.recursive.eco/channels/kids-stories?link=...&title=...&description=...`
   - Need to investigate channels app to fix modal trigger

2. **Missing Channel Selection**
   - Currently hardcoded to "kids-stories" channel
   - Need intermediary step to let user choose which channel to submit to
   - Should show list of available channels before redirecting

**Current Implementation Location:**
- File: `recursive-creator/app/dashboard/sequences/new/page.tsx`
- Lines: 975-1018 (success modal with submit button)
- Current URL: Line 1005

---

#### **NEW PLAN: Fix Submission + Add Channel Selection**

**Step 1: Investigate Channels App Modal Issue** (20 min)
- Check `recursive-channels-fresh` for how submit modal works
- Find where query params should trigger modal opening
- Identify why pre-fill is not working
- Fix modal trigger and pre-fill logic

**Step 2: Add Channel Selection Modal** (40 min)
- Create new modal in recursive-creator that shows BEFORE redirecting
- Fetch available channels from recursive-channels-fresh
- Display channel options (Kids Stories, Wellness, etc.)
- User selects channel → then redirect with pre-filled data

**Step 3: Update Submit Button Flow** (10 min)
- Change "Submit to Community Stories" button to "Submit to Channel"
- On click, open channel selection modal (don't redirect immediately)
- After channel selected, redirect to that channel's submit page

---

#### **Implementation Details:**

**A) Channel Selection Modal UI** (recursive-creator)

```tsx
// Add state
const [showChannelSelectModal, setShowChannelSelectModal] = useState(false);
const [selectedChannel, setSelectedChannel] = useState<string | null>(null);

// Available channels (can fetch from API later)
const AVAILABLE_CHANNELS = [
  { id: 'kids-stories', name: 'Kids Stories', description: 'Children\'s books, educational content' },
  { id: 'wellness', name: 'Wellness', description: 'Mental health, mindfulness, self-care' },
  { id: 'learning', name: 'Learning', description: 'Educational resources, tutorials' },
];

// Modal component
{showChannelSelectModal && (
  <div className="fixed inset-0 bg-black/50 backdrop-blur-sm flex items-center justify-center z-50 p-4">
    <div className="bg-gray-800 rounded-lg shadow-xl max-w-2xl w-full p-6">
      <div className="flex items-center justify-between mb-4">
        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-white">Select a Channel</h3>
        <button
          onClick={() => setShowChannelSelectModal(false)}
          className="text-gray-400 hover:text-white"
        >
          ✕
        </button>
      </div>

      <p className="text-gray-300 mb-6">
        Choose which community channel to submit your content to:
      </p>

      <div className="space-y-3">
        {AVAILABLE_CHANNELS.map((channel) => (
          <button
            key={channel.id}
            onClick={() => {
              setSelectedChannel(channel.id);
              // Redirect to channels app with pre-fill
              const submitUrl = `https://channels.recursive.eco/channels/${channel.id}?link=${encodeURIComponent(publishedUrl)}&title=${encodeURIComponent(title)}&description=${encodeURIComponent(description || '')}`;
              window.open(submitUrl, '_blank');
              setShowChannelSelectModal(false);
            }}
            className="w-full text-left p-4 bg-gray-700 hover:bg-gray-600 rounded-lg border border-gray-600 hover:border-purple-500 transition-all"
          >
            <h4 className="font-semibold text-white mb-1">{channel.name}</h4>
            <p className="text-sm text-gray-400">{channel.description}</p>
          </button>
        ))}
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
)}
```

**B) Update Submit Button** (recursive-creator)

```tsx
{/* Change from direct link to button that opens modal */}
<button
  onClick={() => setShowChannelSelectModal(true)}
  className="inline-block px-6 py-2 bg-purple-600 text-white rounded-lg font-semibold hover:bg-purple-700 transition-colors"
>
  📢 Submit to Channel →
</button>
```

**C) Fix Channels App Modal** (recursive-channels-fresh)

Need to investigate:
- Where is the submit modal in channels app?
- How does it detect query params and pre-fill?
- Is there a missing event listener or state initialization?
- Does modal auto-open when query params are present?

---

#### **OLD Implementation (For Reference)**

**File:** `recursive-creator/app/dashboard/sequences/new/page.tsx`

Current code that needs updating:

```tsx
{/* Success message with channel submission */}
{success && isPublished && publishedUrl && (
  <div className="bg-green-50 border border-green-200 rounded-lg p-6 mb-6">
    <h3 className="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-3">
      🎉 Published Successfully!
    </h3>
    <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
      Your content is now live at:{' '}
      <a
        href={publishedUrl}
        target="_blank"
        rel="noopener"
        className="text-purple-600 hover:text-purple-700 underline font-semibold"
      >
        {publishedUrl}
      </a>
    </p>

    {/* Submit to Community Channel button */}
    <div className="bg-white border border-purple-200 rounded-lg p-4">
      <h4 className="font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-2">
        📢 Share with the Community
      </h4>
      <p className="text-sm text-gray-700 mb-3">
        Submit your content to the Kids Stories channel so other families can discover it!
      </p>
      <p className="text-xs text-gray-600 mb-3 italic">
        💡 You can also share links from trusted sources like Goodreads (book recommendations),
        Claude/ChatGPT (AI tools), Amazon (products), or Google Drive (shared files).
      </p>
      <a
        href={buildChannelSubmitUrl(publishedUrl, title, description)}
        target="_blank"
        rel="noopener"
        className="inline-block px-6 py-2 bg-purple-600 text-white rounded-lg font-semibold hover:bg-purple-700"
      >
        Submit to Community Stories →
      </a>
      <p className="text-xs text-gray-500 mt-2">
        Opens in channels.recursive.eco with your content pre-filled.
        You can review before submitting.
      </p>
    </div>
  </div>
)}

// Helper function
const buildChannelSubmitUrl = (link: string, title: string, desc: string) => {
  const url = new URL('https://channels.recursive.eco/submit');
  url.searchParams.set('link', link);
  url.searchParams.set('title', title);
  url.searchParams.set('description', desc || '');
  url.searchParams.set('channel', 'kids-stories');
  return url.toString();
};
```

---

### Phase 8.3: Link Validation for Channels (Week 2) - AFTER 8.2 Works

**Goal:** Add link validation to channels, but allow multiple trusted domains (not just recursive.eco)

**Strategy:** Test workflow first (8.2), then add smart validation that supports content curation

**Allowed Domains:**
- `recursive.eco` (all subdomains) - Own content
- `goodreads.com` - Book recommendations
- `claude.ai` - AI tools/resources
- `chatgpt.com` / `openai.com` - AI tools/resources
- `amazon.com` - Product recommendations
- `drive.google.com` - Shared documents, images, files

**Rationale:**
- Support content curation from trusted platforms
- Still maintain quality control (no random spam sites)
- Flexible enough for different content types
- Google Drive allows sharing resources without self-hosting

---

#### **Implementation: Multi-Domain Validation**

**File:** `recursive-channels-fresh/app/submit/page.tsx` (or wherever submit form lives)

```tsx
// Allowed domains for channel submissions
const ALLOWED_DOMAINS = [
  'recursive.eco',
  'goodreads.com',
  'claude.ai',
  'chatgpt.com',
  'openai.com',
  'amazon.com',
  'drive.google.com'
];

// Validate that submitted link is from allowed domain
const isValidLink = (url: string): boolean => {
  try {
    const parsedUrl = new URL(url);
    const hostname = parsedUrl.hostname;

    // Check if hostname matches any allowed domain (including subdomains)
    return ALLOWED_DOMAINS.some(domain =>
      hostname === domain || hostname.endsWith(`.${domain}`)
    );
  } catch {
    return false;
  }
};

// Show helpful error if link not allowed
{linkUrl && !isValidLink(linkUrl) && (
  <div className="bg-red-50 border border-red-200 rounded p-4 mb-4">
    <p className="text-sm text-red-800 mb-2">
      <strong>Link not from allowed domain.</strong>
    </p>
    <p className="text-sm text-gray-700 mb-2">
      For quality control, we only accept links from these trusted sources:
    </p>
    <ul className="text-xs text-gray-600 list-disc list-inside space-y-1">
      <li><strong>recursive.eco</strong> - Your own published content</li>
      <li><strong>goodreads.com</strong> - Book recommendations</li>
      <li><strong>claude.ai, chatgpt.com</strong> - AI tools & resources</li>
      <li><strong>amazon.com</strong> - Product recommendations</li>
      <li><strong>drive.google.com</strong> - Shared documents & files</li>
    </ul>
    <p className="text-sm text-gray-700 mt-2">
      To share your own content, publish it at{' '}
      <a href="https://creator.recursive.eco" className="text-blue-600 underline">
        creator.recursive.eco
      </a>{' '}
      first, then submit the recursive.eco/view/... link here.
    </p>
  </div>
)}

// Also disable submit button if link invalid
<button
  onClick={handleSubmit}
  disabled={submitting || !linkUrl || !isValidLink(linkUrl)}
  className="..."
>
  Submit to Channel
</button>
```

---

### Phase 8.4: Call-to-Action Banner (Later)

**Location:** `recursive-landing/view.html` (or wherever the viewer lives)

**Implementation:**
```html
<!-- CTA Banner - Show above content (hero section) -->
<div class="bg-gradient-to-r from-purple-600 to-indigo-600 text-white p-6 text-center mb-8 rounded-lg">
  <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-2">✨ Create Your Own Story</h3>
  <p class="text-sm mb-4 opacity-90">
    Share stories that reflect your family's experiences and culture
  </p>
  <a
    href="https://creator.recursive.eco/dashboard/sequences/new"
    class="inline-block px-8 py-3 bg-white text-purple-600 rounded-lg font-semibold hover:bg-gray-100 transition-colors"
  >
    Start Creating →
  </a>
</div>

<!-- Optional: Hide CTA if viewing own content -->
<script>
  // Check if viewer is the creator (via URL param or session)
  const urlParams = new URLSearchParams(window.location.search);
  const isOwnContent = urlParams.get('preview') === 'true'; // or other logic

  if (isOwnContent) {
    document.querySelector('.cta-banner')?.remove();
  }
</script>
```

---

### Phase 8.5: Dev Branch Strategy (Cross-Repo Coordination)

**Branch Name:** `feature/publishing-workflow-20251119`

**Affected Repositories:**
1. **recursive-landing** - About page terms update
2. **recursive-creator** - License checkbox + channel submission button
3. **recursive-channels-fresh** - Submit form validation (recursive.eco links only)

**Workflow:**

```bash
# Step 1: Create branches in all repos
cd recursive-landing
git checkout -b feature/publishing-workflow-20251119

cd ../recursive-creator
git checkout -b feature/publishing-workflow-20251119

cd ../recursive-channels-fresh
git checkout -b feature/publishing-workflow-20251119

# Step 2: Make changes in parallel
# - Landing: Update about.html (add licensing section)
# - Creator: Add license checkbox + success modal with channel submit button
# - Channels: Add link validation (recursive.eco only)

# Step 3: Test locally with all 3 running
npm run dev # In each repo on different ports

# Step 4: Commit and push
git add .
git commit -m "feat: implement publishing workflow with licensing and channel submission"
git push origin feature/publishing-workflow-20251119

# Step 5: Deploy to dev/staging for testing

# Step 6: Merge to main after testing
git checkout main
git merge feature/publishing-workflow-20251119
git push origin main
```

**Testing Checklist:**
- [ ] About page shows new licensing section with CC BY-SA 4.0 link
- [ ] Creator dashboard requires license checkbox to publish
- [ ] Success modal appears after publishing with channel submit button
- [ ] Channel submit button opens channels.recursive.eco with pre-filled form
- [ ] Channels form accepts pre-filled query params
- [ ] Channels form rejects non-recursive.eco links
- [ ] Full workflow: create → publish → submit → approve works end-to-end

---

### Implementation Priority (REVISED 2025-11-19)

**Phase 8.1: Legal Foundation** ✅ COMPLETE - not actually... 
1. ✅ Update about.html with licensing section
2. ✅ Add license checkbox to creator dashboard

#### USer comments on revisions:
There is just one thing missing here. I tested the workflow again and the recursive creator submission is actually submitting to the wellness channels. I think we just need to change the way the URL is being built.

Right now, it is: https://channels.recursive.eco/?doc_id=f37a5678-aeaf-46f3-81a0-7a90d5e59455&channel=kids-stories

I think it need to start with this for Supabase to recognize the right channel when publishing, what do you think?
https://channels.recursive.eco/channels/kids-stories

You changed the URl and I tested the new feature and the redirect to channels is working, but the modal for subnission is not poping up or pre filling. 

**Phase 8.2: Submit to Community Button** 🔄 NEXT (Test workflow FIRST)
3. ⏳ Add "Submit to Community" success modal in creator
4. ⏳ Verify channels submit form accepts query params
5. ⏳ Test full workflow: publish → submit → appears in channels
   - **Goal:** Ensure basic workflow works before adding restrictions



**Phase 8.4: CTA Banner** (Later)
7. ⏳ Add CTA banner to viewer linking to creator page - something discrete but visible with something like "create your  own content sequences" 
8. ⏳ Hide CTA when viewing own content - This is not necessary, we can add the CTA always with cleaner code 

**Phase 8.5: Testing & Refinement**
9. ⏳ Test full workflow end-to-end
10. ⏳ Gather feedback from test users
11. ⏳ Refine UX based on feedback

## Phase 9: YouTube Playlist Batch Import (OPTIONAL ENHANCEMENT)

**Date:** TBD (After Phase 8 complete)
**Status:** Future Planning
**Goal:** Allow batch import of all videos from a YouTube playlist URL

**Priority:** Low (nice-to-have after basic publishing workflow is solid)

---

### Feature Overview

**Current State:** Users can add YouTube videos one-by-one by pasting individual URLs

**Desired State:** Paste ONE YouTube playlist URL → automatically import all video IDs (up to 50)

**Similar to:** Drive folder import (Phase 7) - same pattern, different API

---

### Implementation Plan

#### **A) Backend API Route**

**File:** `recursive-creator/app/api/extract-playlist/route.ts` (new)

```typescript
import { NextRequest, NextResponse } from 'next/server';

export async function POST(request: NextRequest) {
  try {
    const { playlistUrl } = await request.json();

    // Extract playlist ID from URL
    const playlistId = extractPlaylistId(playlistUrl);
    if (!playlistId) {
      return NextResponse.json(
        { error: 'Invalid YouTube playlist URL' },
        { status: 400 }
      );
    }

    // Use YouTube Data API v3 to fetch all videos in playlist
    const apiKey = process.env.GOOGLE_YOUTUBE_API_KEY;
    const response = await fetch(
      `https://www.googleapis.com/youtube/v3/playlistItems?` +
      `part=snippet&maxResults=50&playlistId=${playlistId}&key=${apiKey}`
    );

    if (!response.ok) {
      throw new Error('YouTube API request failed');
    }

    const data = await response.json();

    // Extract video IDs and titles
    const videos = data.items.map((item: any) => ({
      video_id: item.snippet.resourceId.videoId,
      title: item.snippet.title,
      url: `https://youtube.com/watch?v=${item.snippet.resourceId.videoId}`,
      thumbnail: item.snippet.thumbnails.default.url
    }));

    return NextResponse.json({ videos, count: videos.length });
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Playlist extraction error:', error);
    return NextResponse.json(
      { error: 'Failed to extract playlist videos' },
      { status: 500 }
    );
  }
}

function extractPlaylistId(url: string): string | null {
  // Handle various YouTube playlist URL formats
  const patterns = [
    /[?&]list=([^&]+)/,           // ?list=PLxxx
    /\/playlist\?list=([^&]+)/,   // /playlist?list=PLxxx
  ];

  for (const pattern of patterns) {
    const match = url.match(pattern);
    if (match) return match[1];
  }
  return null;
}
```

---

#### **B) Frontend UI Addition**

**File:** `recursive-creator/app/dashboard/sequences/new/page.tsx`

Add next to Drive folder import button:

```tsx
{/* YouTube Playlist Import Button */}
<button
  onClick={() => setShowPlaylistModal(true)}
  className="text-sm text-purple-600 hover:text-purple-700 font-medium flex items-center gap-2"
>
  🎬 Import YouTube Playlist
</button>

{/* Playlist Import Modal */}
{showPlaylistModal && (
  <div className="fixed inset-0 bg-black bg-opacity-50 flex items-center justify-center z-50">
    <div className="bg-white rounded-lg p-6 max-w-md w-full">
      <h3 className="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">
        Import YouTube Playlist
      </h3>
      <p className="text-sm text-gray-600 mb-4">
        Paste a YouTube playlist URL to import all videos at once (max 50 videos).
      </p>

      <input
        type="text"
        value={playlistUrl}
        onChange={(e) => setPlaylistUrl(e.target.value)}
        placeholder="https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLxxx..."
        className="w-full px-4 py-2 border border-gray-300 rounded mb-4"
      />

      {playlistError && (
        <div className="bg-red-50 border border-red-200 rounded p-3 mb-4">
          <p className="text-sm text-red-800">{playlistError}</p>
        </div>
      )}

      <div className="flex justify-end gap-2">
        <button
          onClick={() => {
            setShowPlaylistModal(false);
            setPlaylistUrl('');
            setPlaylistError(null);
          }}
          className="px-4 py-2 border border-gray-300 rounded hover:bg-gray-50"
        >
          Cancel
        </button>
        <button
          onClick={handleImportPlaylist}
          disabled={importingPlaylist || !playlistUrl}
          className="px-4 py-2 bg-purple-600 text-white rounded hover:bg-purple-700 disabled:opacity-50"
        >
          {importingPlaylist ? 'Importing...' : 'Import Videos'}
        </button>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
)}
```

**Handler function:**

```tsx
const handleImportPlaylist = async () => {
  setImportingPlaylist(true);
  setPlaylistError(null);

  try {
    const response = await fetch('/api/extract-playlist', {
      method: 'POST',
      headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
      body: JSON.stringify({ playlistUrl })
    });

    const data = await response.json();

    if (!response.ok) {
      throw new Error(data.error || 'Failed to import playlist');
    }

    // Add all videos to items array
    const newItems: SequenceItem[] = data.videos.map((video: any, index: number) => ({
      position: items.length + index + 1,
      type: 'video' as ItemType,
      video_id: video.video_id,
      url: video.url,
      title: video.title
    }));

    setItems([...items, ...newItems]);
    setShowPlaylistModal(false);
    setPlaylistUrl('');

    // Success message
    alert(`Successfully imported ${data.count} videos!`);
  } catch (err: any) {
    setPlaylistError(err.message || 'Failed to import playlist');
  } finally {
    setImportingPlaylist(false);
  }
};
```

**State to add:**

```tsx
const [showPlaylistModal, setShowPlaylistModal] = useState(false);
const [playlistUrl, setPlaylistUrl] = useState('');
const [importingPlaylist, setImportingPlaylist] = useState(false);
const [playlistError, setPlaylistError] = useState<string | null>(null);
```

---

### Technical Details

**Dependencies:**
- Google YouTube Data API key (same as Drive API key - `GOOGLE_YOUTUBE_API_KEY`)
- Can reuse existing API key if you have one
- Free tier: 10,000 quota units/day
- Playlist request costs: ~3 units (1 for list + 2 for snippet data)

**Limitations:**
- Only works with PUBLIC playlists
- Max 50 videos per request (YouTube API limit)
- If playlist has >50 videos, need pagination (future enhancement)
- Quota limits: ~3,000 playlist imports per day on free tier

**User Flow:**
1. User clicks "🎬 Import YouTube Playlist"
2. Modal appears with input field
3. User pastes playlist URL (e.g., `https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLxxx`)
4. System validates URL format
5. Backend calls YouTube Data API
6. Returns array of video IDs and titles
7. Frontend adds all videos to items array
8. User can review, reorder, remove, or edit titles
9. Save as normal sequence

---

### Estimated Time & Priority

**Time Estimate:** 2-3 hours (similar to Drive folder import complexity)

**Priority:** **LOW** - Optional enhancement after core publishing workflow (Phase 8) is complete

**When to implement:**
- ✅ Phase 8 (publishing workflow + licensing) is complete
- ✅ Users are actively creating playlists
- ✅ Users request this feature (measure demand first!)

**Why low priority:**
- Current workflow (one-by-one) works fine for most use cases
- Playlists are typically 5-10 videos, not 50
- Can add later based on user feedback

---

## Phase 10: Content Reporting & Auto-Moderation (FUTURE)

**Problem:** Need way for viewers to report inappropriate content while preventing abuse

**Solution:** Automatic moderation with appeals process (no manual dashboard needed!)

**Location:** `/view.html` (recursive-landing)

**UI:**
```html
<!-- Discreet button in viewer controls -->
<div class="viewer-controls">
  <button id="prev-btn">← Previous</button>
  <button id="fullscreen-btn">⛶ Fullscreen</button>
  <button id="next-btn">Next →</button>

  <!-- NEW: Report button (subtle, not prominent) -->
  <button id="report-btn" class="text-red-600 text-sm ml-4">
    ⚠ Report
  </button>
</div>
```

**Auto-Moderation Flow:**

**1. First Report (on any content):**
```javascript
async function submitReport() {
  // POST /api/report-content
  const response = await fetch('/api/report-content', {
    method: 'POST',
    body: JSON.stringify({
      content_id: storyId,
      reason: selectedReason, // explicit/violence/hate/other
      details: optionalText
    })
  });

  // AUTOMATIC ACTIONS:
  // 1. Unpublish the reported content (set is_public = false)
  // 2. Increment report_count on that content
  // 3. Increment total_reports_received on creator's profile
  // 4. Send email to creator: "Your story was reported and unpublished. Reply to appeal."
  // 5. Send email to admin: "Content reported and auto-unpublished. Details: [reason]"
  // 6. Show "Thank you" to reporter
}
```

**2. Third Report (across all user's content):**
```javascript
// When total_reports_received >= 3:
// AUTOMATIC ACTIONS:
// 1. Set account_status = 'on_hold' in profiles
// 2. Unpublish ALL their content
// 3. Block new publishing (show message: "Account on hold, contact support")
// 4. Send email to creator: "Your account is on hold due to multiple reports. You may appeal by replying to this email with your explanation."
// 5. Send email to admin: "User account on hold after 3 reports. Awaiting your review of appeals."
```

**3. Appeals Process:**
- Creator replies to email with explanation
- You manually review the appeal
- Options:
  - **Restore:** Change account_status back to 'active', allow republishing
  - **Ban:** Change account_status to 'banned', permanent restriction
  - **Partial restore:** Restore account but keep specific content unpublished

**Database Structure:**
```sql
-- Add to user_documents
ALTER TABLE user_documents ADD COLUMN report_count INTEGER DEFAULT 0;

-- Add to profiles
ALTER TABLE profiles ADD COLUMN account_status TEXT DEFAULT 'active'; -- 'active' | 'on_hold' | 'banned'
ALTER TABLE profiles ADD COLUMN total_reports_received INTEGER DEFAULT 0;
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Immediate action on reports (safety first)
- ✅ No moderation dashboard needed initially
- ✅ Prevents abuse (manual appeals review catches false reports)
- ✅ Scales with community (only review appeals, not every report)
- ✅ Email-based workflow (simple, no new UI needed)

**When to implement:** After Phase 8 is complete and community features are active

## Phase 11: YouTube End-Screen Overlay (Hide Suggested Videos)

**Date:** 2025-11-20
**Status:** Planning
**Goal:** Prevent YouTube suggested videos thumbnails from appearing at video end
**Priority:** HIGH (improves "safer for kids" value proposition)

---

### Problem Statement

**Current Issue:**
- YouTube's `rel=0` parameter NO LONGER works (deprecated since 2018)
- End-screen shows related videos from other channels (can't be fully hidden)
- Defeats our "safer for kids" and "bounded experience" goals
- Users might click away to random YouTube content

**User Request:**
> "Can you help me prevent the showcase of additional thumbnails at the end of youtube videos? rel=0 does no longer do that."

**Suggested Solution:**
Use `enablejsapi=1` with YouTube IFrame Player API to:
1. Detect when video ends (`onStateChange` event)
2. Overlay custom UI (replay button, next item button, or static image)
3. Cover the suggested videos completely

---

### Current Implementation

**File:** `components/viewers/SequenceViewer.tsx:150-156`

```tsx
<iframe
  src={`https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/${currentItem.video_id}?rel=0&modestbranding=1`}
  title={currentItem.title || `Video ${currentItem.position}`}
  className="w-full aspect-video rounded-lg"
  allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"
  allowFullScreen
/>
```

**Current Parameters:**
- ✅ `youtube-nocookie.com` - Privacy-enhanced mode
- ✅ `rel=0` - Attempts to hide related videos (NO LONGER WORKS)
- ✅ `modestbranding=1` - Minimal YouTube branding

---

### Proposed Solution: YouTube IFrame Player API Integration

#### **Step 1: Load YouTube IFrame API**

Add to `components/viewers/SequenceViewer.tsx`:

```tsx
// Add to component imports
import Script from 'next/script';

// Add state for player
const [youtubePlayer, setYoutubePlayer] = useState<any>(null);
const [videoEnded, setVideoEnded] = useState(false);
const playerRef = useRef<any>(null);

// Add effect to initialize player when API loads
useEffect(() => {
  // Make onYouTubeIframeAPIReady available globally
  (window as any).onYouTubeIframeAPIReady = () => {
    console.log('YouTube IFrame API ready');
  };
}, []);

// Add effect to create player when video changes
useEffect(() => {
  if (currentItem.type === 'video' && currentItem.video_id && currentItem.video_id.length === 11) {
    // Reset video ended state when changing videos
    setVideoEnded(false);

    // Wait for API to be ready, then create player
    if ((window as any).YT && (window as any).YT.Player) {
      const player = new (window as any).YT.Player(`youtube-player-${currentItem.video_id}`, {
        videoId: currentItem.video_id,
        playerVars: {
          rel: 0,
          modestbranding: 1,
          enablejsapi: 1
        },
        events: {
          onStateChange: (event: any) => {
            // YT.PlayerState.ENDED = 0
            if (event.data === 0) {
              setVideoEnded(true);
            }
          }
        }
      });

      setYoutubePlayer(player);
      playerRef.current = player;
    }
  }

  // Cleanup player on unmount or item change
  return () => {
    if (playerRef.current) {
      playerRef.current.destroy();
      playerRef.current = null;
    }
  };
}, [currentItem]);
```

#### **Step 2: Update YouTube Embed Structure**

Replace iframe with div for YouTube Player API:

```tsx
{currentItem.type === 'video' && (
  <div className="w-full h-full flex items-center justify-center p-4 relative">
    <div className="w-full max-w-4xl relative">
      {currentItem.video_id && currentItem.video_id.length === 11 ? (
        // YouTube video with Player API
        <>
          <div
            id={`youtube-player-${currentItem.video_id}`}
            className="w-full aspect-video rounded-lg"
          />

          {/* Custom overlay when video ends */}
          {videoEnded && (
            <div className="absolute inset-0 bg-black/90 rounded-lg flex flex-col items-center justify-center gap-6 z-10">
              <div className="text-center">
                <h3 className="text-white text-2xl font-bold mb-2">
                  {currentItem.title || 'Video Complete'}
                </h3>
                <p className="text-gray-300">
                  What would you like to do next?
                </p>
              </div>

              <div className="flex gap-4">
                {/* Replay Button */}
                <button
                  onClick={() => {
                    playerRef.current?.seekTo(0);
                    playerRef.current?.playVideo();
                    setVideoEnded(false);
                  }}
                  className="px-8 py-4 bg-purple-600 hover:bg-purple-700 text-white rounded-lg font-semibold flex items-center gap-2 transition-all"
                >
                  <svg className="w-6 h-6" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" viewBox="0 0 24 24">

                  </svg>
                  Replay
                </button>

                {/* Next Item Button (if not last) */}
                {currentIndex < items.length - 1 && (
                  <button
                    onClick={() => {
                      setVideoEnded(false);
                      goToNext();
                    }}
                    className="px-8 py-4 bg-blue-600 hover:bg-blue-700 text-white rounded-lg font-semibold flex items-center gap-2 transition-all"
                  >
                    Next Item
                    <svg className="w-6 h-6" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" viewBox="0 0 24 24">

                    </svg>
                  </button>
                )}

                {/* Back to Start Button (if last item) */}
                {currentIndex === items.length - 1 && (
                  <button
                    onClick={() => {
                      setVideoEnded(false);
                      setCurrentIndex(0);

                    Back to Start
                  </button>
                )}
              </div>
            </div>
          )}
        </>
      ) : (
        // Google Drive video (unchanged)
        <iframe
          src={`https://drive.google.com/file/d/${currentItem.video_id}/preview`}
          title={currentItem.title || `Video ${currentItem.position}`}
          className="w-full aspect-video rounded-lg"
          allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"
          allowFullScreen
        />
      )}
    </div>

    {/* Video title overlay (keep existing) */}
    {currentItem.title && !videoEnded && (
      <div className="absolute bottom-8 left-0 right-0 text-center pointer-events-none">
        <p className="text-white text-lg px-6 py-3 bg-black/50 rounded-lg backdrop-blur-sm inline-block">
          {currentItem.title}
        </p>
      </div>
    )}
  </div>
)}
```

#### **Step 3: Add YouTube API Script Tag**

Add to the component return (before the main div):

```tsx
return (
  <>
    {/* Load YouTube IFrame API */}
    <Script
      src="https://www.youtube.com/iframe_api"
      strategy="afterInteractive"
      onLoad={() => {
        console.log('YouTube API script loaded');
      }}
    />

    <div
      ref={containerRef}
      className="relative w-full h-screen bg-black flex flex-col"
      // ... rest of component
    >
```

### Implementation Checklist

**Phase 11.1: Basic Integration**
- [ ] Add YouTube IFrame API script tag with Next.js `<Script>`
- [ ] Add state management for player and video end detection
- [ ] Replace YouTube iframe with API-controlled div
- [ ] Initialize YouTube Player with `enablejsapi=1`
- [ ] Add `onStateChange` event listener for video end (state = 0)

**Phase 11.2: Custom End-Screen Overlay**
- [ ] Create overlay component (dark background with controls)
- [ ] Add "Replay" button (seeks to 0, plays video)
- [ ] Add "Next Item" button (navigates to next, if exists)
- [ ] Add "Back to Start" button (goes to first item, if at end)
- [ ] Style overlay to match existing dark mode design

**Phase 11.3: Edge Cases & Polish**
- [ ] Handle manual navigation away from ended video (reset `videoEnded` state)
- [ ] Handle fullscreen mode (overlay should work in fullscreen too)
- [ ] Test with playlists that mix images and videos
- [ ] Test swipe navigation while overlay is showing
- [ ] Ensure keyboard navigation still works

**Phase 11.4: Testing**
- [ ] Test on mobile (touch targets large enough?)
- [ ] Test on desktop (hover states work?)
- [ ] Test with sequences of all videos
- [ ] Test with mixed sequences (images + videos)
- [ ] Test in fullscreen mode
- [ ] Verify suggested videos are completely hidden

### Technical Details

**YouTube Player States:**
- `-1` (unstarted)
- `0` (ended) ← **This is what we detect**
- `1` (playing)
- `2` (paused)
- `3` (buffering)
- `5` (video cued)

**API Documentation:**
- [YouTube IFrame Player API](https://developers.google.com/youtube/iframe_api_reference)
- [Player Parameters](https://developers.google.com/youtube/player_parameters)
- [Events Reference](https://developers.google.com/youtube/iframe_api_reference#Events)

**Key Parameters:**
- `enablejsapi=1` - Enable API control
- `rel=0` - Still include (limits related videos to same channel)
- `modestbranding=1` - Minimal YouTube branding

**Why This Works:**
- ✅ Overlay covers the entire iframe when video ends
- ✅ `z-index: 10` ensures overlay is on top
- ✅ User can't see or click suggested videos
- ✅ Maintains "bounded experience" goal
- ✅ Provides clear next actions (replay, next, or restart)

---

### Benefits

**For Parents (Safety):**
- ✅ Kids can't click random suggested videos
- ✅ Bounded experience - stays within your curated content
- ✅ Clear navigation options at video end

**For Creators (Control):**
- ✅ Your playlists stay cohesive
- ✅ Viewers engage with YOUR sequence, not YouTube's suggestions
- ✅ Professional, polished UX

**For Platform (Value Prop):**
- ✅ Strengthens "safer for kids" positioning
- ✅ Differentiates from raw YouTube embeds
- ✅ Aligns with "narrative context" goal (you control the flow)

---

### Alternative Approaches (Considered & Rejected)

**Option A: CSS-only overlay**
- ❌ Can't detect video end without API
- ❌ Timing would be manual and unreliable

**Option B: Custom video player (not YouTube)**
- ❌ Massive complexity increase
- ❌ Violates YouTube ToS (can't download videos)
- ❌ Loses YouTube features (quality switching, captions, etc.)

**Option C: Just accept suggested videos**
- ❌ Defeats "safer for kids" goal
- ❌ Undermines platform value proposition
- ❌ User explicitly requested this feature

**Option D (CHOSEN): YouTube IFrame Player API**
- ✅ Official YouTube API
- ✅ Detects video end reliably
- ✅ Allows custom overlay
- ✅ Maintains YouTube features
- ✅ 2-3 hours implementation time

---

### Estimated Time

**Total:** 3-4 hours

**Breakdown:**
- 1 hour: API integration + player initialization
- 1 hour: Custom overlay UI + button logic
- 1 hour: Testing edge cases (navigation, fullscreen, etc.)
- 30 min: Polish and refinement

---

### Priority Justification

**Why HIGH Priority:**
1. User explicitly requested this feature
2. Directly supports "safer for kids" value proposition
3. YouTube removed `rel=0` functionality - we need a replacement
4. Differentiates our platform from basic YouTube embeds
5. Relatively quick implementation (3-4 hours)

**When to Implement:**
- Can be done in parallel with Phase 8 (publishing workflow)
- OR immediately after Phase 8.1 (legal foundation) is complete
- Does not depend on other features

---

### Next Steps

**Branch Strategy:**
- Working on existing branch: `dev/feature/publishing-workflow` (across all projects)
- Switch to this branch in both recursive-creator AND recursive-landing
- Implement YouTube fix in both places

**Implementation Order:**

**Phase 11A: Fix in recursive-creator (React viewer)**
1. Switch to `dev/feature/publishing-workflow` branch
2. Implement Phase 11.1 (basic API integration) in `SequenceViewer.tsx`
3. Implement Phase 11.2 (custom overlay) in React
4. Test thoroughly (Phase 11.3-11.4)

**Phase 11B: Fix in recursive-landing (Vanilla JS viewer)**
1. Switch recursive-landing to `dev/feature/publishing-workflow` branch
2. Implement same logic in `pages/content/viewer.html` (vanilla JS)
3. Simpler implementation (no React boilerplate)
4. Test to ensure iframe embedding still works from creator

**Phase 11C: Testing & Deployment**
1. Test both viewers independently
2. Test creator → landing iframe integration
3. Deploy to dev for user testing
4. Merge to main once validated

**User Testing Questions:**
- Does the overlay completely hide suggested videos?
- Are the buttons easy to tap on mobile?
- Does it feel natural in the sequence viewing flow?
- Any edge cases where overlay doesn't appear?
- Does iframe embedding still work correctly?

**Note:** Vanilla JS implementation in recursive-landing will be simpler and more direct than React version. Both will use the same YouTube IFrame Player API core logic.

### Phase 11 - User Testing Feedback & Bug Fixes (2025-11-20)

**Status:** 🔄 IN PROGRESS - Bugs found, fixes needed

**What Was Completed:**
- ✅ Phase 11A: YouTube Player API implemented in recursive-creator (SequenceViewer.tsx)
- ✅ Phase 11B: YouTube Player API implemented in recursive-landing (view.html)
- ✅ Both viewers have end-screen overlay with Replay/Next buttons
- ✅ Both viewers have play/pause overlay controls
- ✅ Locked experience with controls=0, fs=0, iv_load_policy=3

**Issues Found During Testing:**

**Issue #1: recursive-landing Fullscreen Sizing** 🐛 HIGH PRIORITY
- **Problem:** Fullscreen mode works, but YouTube video only renders in ~1/8th of the screen
- **Expected:** Video should fill the entire fullscreen area
- **Root Cause:** Missing CSS for fullscreen YouTube player sizing
- **File:** `recursive-landing/view.html`
- **Fix Needed:** Add fullscreen CSS rules for YouTube player container

**Issue #5: Overlay Buttons Don't Work in Fullscreen** 🐛 CRITICAL
- **Problem:** Replay and Next buttons prevent thumbnails but don't respond to clicks in fullscreen
- **User Report:** "The buttons are at least preventing the thumbnails to show, but the replay and next button do not work in fullscreen mode"
- **Works in:** Non-fullscreen mode ✅
- **Fails in:** Fullscreen mode ❌
- **Root Cause (CONFIRMED via research):**
  - When element enters fullscreen, it enters browser's "top layer"
  - Z-index doesn't work in top layer
  - Only DIRECT CHILDREN of fullscreen element are clickable
  - Our overlay buttons might not be proper children of `#viewer-container`
- **Official Documentation:** [MDN Fullscreen API Guide](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fullscreen_API/Guide) and [Chrome Top Layer](https://developer.chrome.com/blog/what-is-the-top-layer)
- **Console Logs Show:**
  - Video end detection works: "Video ended, showing overlay" ✅
  - Navigation works in normal mode: "Displaying item 2/2" ✅
  - No errors when clicking in fullscreen (events not reaching buttons) ❌
- **Fix Strategy:** Ensure overlay is direct child of fullscreen container, not dynamically inserted

**Issue #6: Buttons Don't Show After Replay** 🐛 HIGH PRIORITY
- **Problem:** "When I replayed the video once, the buttons did not show again"
- **User Report:** After clicking Replay, overlay doesn't appear when video ends again
- **Suspected Cause:** State management bug - `videoEnded` not resetting properly or overlay class not being toggled
- **File:** `recursive-landing/view.html`
- **Fix Needed:** Debug replay button logic, ensure overlay state resets correctly

**Issue #2: recursive-creator Needs Full YouTube Controls** 🎯 HIGH PRIORITY
- **Problem:** Locked experience (controls=0, fs=0) is correct for VIEWERS but wrong for CREATORS
- **User Feedback:** "I want to enable back all of youtube functionalities, because that is really important when creating"
- **Reasoning:** Creators need full YouTube controls while editing/previewing:
  - Quality settings
  - Playback speed
  - Captions/subtitles
  - Timeline scrubbing
  - YouTube fullscreen (separate from our fullscreen)
- **Solution:** Different player configurations for creator preview vs. public viewer
  - **Creator mode** (recursive-creator preview): `controls=1, fs=1` (full controls)
  - **Viewer mode** (recursive-landing public): `controls=0, fs=0` (locked experience)
- **File:** `recursive-creator/components/viewers/SequenceViewer.tsx`

**Issue #3: Content Area Cut Off at Bottom** 🐛 MEDIUM PRIORITY
- **Problem:** "The box where the images and movies are rendering are cut in the bottom" (not in fullscreen)
- **Affects:** Both recursive-creator and recursive-landing
- **Suspected Cause:** Container height or padding issues
- **Fix Needed:** Investigate container CSS, ensure full content visible

**Issue #4: Fullscreen Button Missing in recursive-creator** 🐛 HIGH PRIORITY
- **Problem:** "Before there was a fullscreen button coming from the react app that is no longer showing"
- **Location:** Should be in viewer controls at bottom
- **File:** `recursive-creator/components/viewers/SequenceViewer.tsx:385-408`
- **Expected:** Fullscreen button should always be visible (not tied to overlay visibility)

---

### Phase 11C: Bug Fixes & UX Enhancements Implementation Plan

**User Decision on Issue #2:** Keep YouTube Player API, change to `controls=1, fs=1` for creator mode

**New UX Requirements for recursive-landing:**
- Add visible play/pause button (not just hover overlay)
- Add video timeline scrubbing controls (seek forward/backward)
- Make video controls more discoverable and accessible

**Priority Order:**
1. **Fix #4** - Restore fullscreen button in recursive-creator (5 min)
2. **Fix #2** - Enable full YouTube controls for creator mode (10 min) - Keep API, set controls=1, fs=1
3. **Fix #5** - Fix overlay buttons not clickable in fullscreen (CRITICAL - 20 min)
4. **Fix #6** - Fix buttons not showing after replay (10 min)
5. **Enhancement #1** - Add play/pause button to recursive-landing viewer (15 min)
6. **Enhancement #2** - Add timeline scrubbing controls to recursive-landing (30 min)
7. **Fix #1** - Fix fullscreen YouTube sizing in recursive-landing (15 min)
8. **Fix #3** - Fix content area bottom cut-off (20 min investigation + fix)

---

#### Fix #1: recursive-landing Fullscreen YouTube Sizing

**File:** `recursive-landing/view.html`

**Problem:** YouTube player not filling fullscreen

**Current CSS (lines 77-117):**
```css
#viewer-container:fullscreen {
    background: black;
    display: flex;
    align-items: center;
    justify-content: center;
}

#viewer-container:fullscreen .content-item {
    max-height: 100vh;
    max-width: 100vw;
}
```

**Missing:** Rules for YouTube player container in fullscreen

**Fix - Add to CSS:**
```css
/* Fullscreen YouTube player sizing */
#viewer-container:fullscreen #content-display > div {
    width: 100vw !important;
    max-width: 100vw !important;
    height: 100vh !important;
    display: flex !important;
    align-items: center !important;
    justify-content: center !important;
}

#viewer-container:fullscreen #content-display > div > div[id^="youtube-player-"] {
    width: 100vw !important;
    height: 100vh !important;
    max-width: 100vw !important;
    max-height: 100vh !important;
}

#viewer-container:fullscreen #play-pause-overlay {
    width: 100vw !important;
    height: 100vh !important;
}
```

**Testing:**
- Click fullscreen button
- Verify YouTube video fills entire screen
- Test play/pause overlay still works
- Test end-screen overlay still covers everything

---

#### Fix #2: Enable Full YouTube Controls for Creator Mode

**File:** `recursive-creator/components/viewers/SequenceViewer.tsx`

**Current (lines 154-160):**
```tsx
playerVars: {
  rel: 0,
  modestbranding: 1,
  enablejsapi: 1,
  controls: 0,        // Hide all YouTube controls
  fs: 0,              // Disable YouTube fullscreen
  iv_load_policy: 3   // Hide annotations
}
```

**Fix - Restore Full Controls for Creators:**
```tsx
playerVars: {
  rel: 0,
  modestbranding: 1,
  enablejsapi: 1,
  controls: 1,        // ✅ ENABLE all YouTube controls for creators
  fs: 1,              // ✅ ENABLE YouTube fullscreen for creators
  iv_load_policy: 3   // Hide annotations (keep this)
}
```

**Also Remove:**
- Play/pause overlay (lines 257-283) - Not needed with full controls
- Can keep end-screen overlay for consistency, but make it optional

**Alternative (Cleaner):**
Remove YouTube Player API entirely from creator mode, go back to simple iframe:

```tsx
{currentItem.video_id && currentItem.video_id.length === 11 ? (
  // Simple iframe for creators - full YouTube controls
  <iframe
    src={`https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/${currentItem.video_id}?rel=0&modestbranding=1`}
    title={currentItem.title || `Video ${currentItem.position}`}
    className="w-full aspect-video rounded-lg"
    allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"
    allowFullScreen
  />
) : (
  // Google Drive video (unchanged)
  <iframe ... />
)}
```

**Reasoning:**
- Creator preview doesn't need locked experience
- Creators need full YouTube functionality (quality, speed, captions, timeline)
- Simpler code = fewer bugs
- Locked experience belongs in PUBLIC viewer (recursive-landing), not creator tool

**Decision:** ✅ Keep Player API, change to `controls=1, fs=1` (Option A chosen by user)

**Implementation:**
```tsx
playerVars: {
  rel: 0,
  modestbranding: 1,
  enablejsapi: 1,
  controls: 1,        // ✅ ENABLE all YouTube controls for creators
  fs: 1,              // ✅ ENABLE YouTube fullscreen for creators
  iv_load_policy: 3   // Hide annotations (keep this)
}
```

**Also Do:**
- Remove play/pause overlay (not needed with native controls)
- Keep end-screen overlay (Replay/Next buttons still useful)

---

#### Enhancement #1: Add Play/Pause Button to recursive-landing

**File:** `recursive-landing/view.html`

**Problem:** Current implementation only has hover overlay - not obvious or accessible

**Solution:** Add always-visible play/pause button below video

**Implementation - Add to Video Display HTML:**

After the YouTube player div, add:

```html
<!-- Video Controls - Always Visible -->
<div id="video-controls" style="margin-top: 16px; display: flex; justify-content: center; gap: 12px; align-items: center;">
  <!-- Play/Pause Button -->
  <button id="play-pause-btn" style="
    width: 56px;
    height: 56px;
    border-radius: 50%;
    background: #9333ea;
    border: none;
    cursor: pointer;
    display: flex;
    align-items: center;
    justify-content: center;
    transition: all 0.3s;
    box-shadow: 0 4px 6px rgba(0,0,0,0.1);
  " onmouseover="this.style.background='#7e22ce'" onmouseout="this.style.background='#9333ea'">
    <svg id="play-icon" style="width: 28px; height: 28px; color: white; margin-left: 3px;" fill="currentColor" viewBox="0 0 24 24">
      <path d="M8 5v14l11-7z" />
    </svg>
    <svg id="pause-icon" style="width: 28px; height: 28px; color: white; display: none;" fill="currentColor" viewBox="0 0 24 24">
      <path d="M6 4h4v16H6V4zm8 0h4v16h-4V4z" />
    </svg>
  </button>

  <!-- Time Display -->
  <div id="time-display" style="
    color: #6b7280;
    font-size: 14px;
    font-family: monospace;
    min-width: 100px;
    text-align: center;
  ">
    0:00 / 0:00
  </div>
</div>
```

**Add Event Listeners in initPlayer():**

```javascript
// Setup play/pause button
const playPauseBtn = document.getElementById('play-pause-btn');
const playIcon = document.getElementById('play-icon');
const pauseIcon = document.getElementById('pause-icon');

if (playPauseBtn) {
  playPauseBtn.addEventListener('click', () => {
    if (!youtubePlayer) return;
    if (isPlaying) {
      youtubePlayer.pauseVideo();
    } else {
      youtubePlayer.playVideo();
    }
  });
}

// Update time display every second
setInterval(() => {
  if (youtubePlayer && youtubePlayer.getCurrentTime) {
    const current = Math.floor(youtubePlayer.getCurrentTime());
    const duration = Math.floor(youtubePlayer.getDuration());

    const currentMin = Math.floor(current / 60);
    const currentSec = (current % 60).toString().padStart(2, '0');
    const durationMin = Math.floor(duration / 60);
    const durationSec = (duration % 60).toString().padStart(2, '0');

    const timeDisplay = document.getElementById('time-display');
    if (timeDisplay) {
      timeDisplay.textContent = `${currentMin}:${currentSec} / ${durationMin}:${durationSec}`;
    }
  }
}, 1000);
```

**Update Icon Visibility in onStateChange:**

```javascript
events: {
  onStateChange: (event) => {
    if (event.data === 0) {
      videoEnded = true;
      isPlaying = false;
      document.getElementById('video-overlay').classList.add('active');
    } else if (event.data === 1) {
      isPlaying = true;
      // Show pause icon
      if (playIcon) playIcon.style.display = 'none';
      if (pauseIcon) pauseIcon.style.display = 'block';
    } else if (event.data === 2) {
      isPlaying = false;
      // Show play icon
      if (playIcon) playIcon.style.display = 'block';
      if (pauseIcon) pauseIcon.style.display = 'none';
    }
  }
}
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Always visible, no hover needed
- ✅ Large touch target (56px)
- ✅ Clear visual feedback (play/pause icons)
- ✅ Shows current time and duration
- ✅ Accessible for mobile users

---

#### Fix #5: Overlay Buttons Not Clickable in Fullscreen (CRITICAL)

**File:** `recursive-landing/view.html`

**Root Cause Analysis:**

When browser fullscreen is activated:
1. The fullscreen element enters the "top layer" (special rendering layer)
2. Z-index has NO effect in top layer
3. Only **direct children** of the fullscreen container can receive events
4. Dynamically inserted elements may not be in the correct DOM position

**Current Structure Problem:**

```javascript
// displayItem() function creates this structure:
display.innerHTML = `
  <div style="position: relative; ...">
    <div id="youtube-player-${videoId}"></div>
    <div id="play-pause-overlay">...</div>
    <div id="video-overlay" class="video-overlay">  // ← End-screen overlay
      <button id="replay-btn">Replay</button>
      <button id="next-btn-overlay">Next</button>
    </div>
  </div>
`;
```

When fullscreen is called on `#viewer-container`, the overlay is nested too deep:
```
#viewer-container (fullscreen element)
  └─ #content-wrapper
      └─ #content-display
          └─ <div> (created by innerHTML)
              └─ #video-overlay (TOO DEEP - events don't reach it!)
```

**Solution: Restructure DOM for Fullscreen Compatibility**

**Option A (Recommended): Move Overlay Outside Dynamic Content**

Don't create overlay via `innerHTML` - keep it as a persistent sibling:

```html
<!-- In view.html static HTML -->
<div id="content-wrapper" class="hidden">
  <div class="relative content-container">
    <div id="content-display" class="w-full"></div>

    <!-- Page Indicator (existing) -->
    <div class="page-indicator">...</div>

    <!-- MOVE OVERLAY HERE - Persistent, not dynamically created -->
    <div id="video-end-overlay" class="video-overlay" style="display: none; z-index: 9999;">
      <div style="text-align: center;">
        <h3 id="overlay-title" style="color: white; font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold; margin-bottom: 8px;">
          Video Complete
        </h3>
        <p style="color: #d1d5db;">What would you like to do next?</p>
      </div>

      <div style="display: flex; gap: 16px; flex-wrap: wrap; justify-content: center;">
        <button id="replay-btn-persistent" class="video-overlay-button" style="background: #9333ea; color: white;">
          <svg style="width: 24px; height: 24px;" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" viewBox="0 0 24 24">
            <path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 4v5h.582m15.356 2A8.001 8.001 0 004.582 9m0 0H9m11 11v-5h-.581m0 0a8.003 8.003 0 01-15.357-2m15.357 2H15" />
          </svg>
          Replay
        </button>

        <button id="next-btn-persistent" class="video-overlay-button" style="background: #2563eb; color: white;">
          Next
          <svg style="width: 24px; height: 24px;" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" viewBox="0 0 24 24">
            <path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M9 5l7 7-7 7" />
          </svg>
        </button>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <!-- Navigation Controls -->
  ...
</div>
```

**Update displayItem() function:**

```javascript
} else if (item.type === 'video') {
  const videoId = item.video_id;

  // Destroy existing player
  if (youtubePlayer) {
    youtubePlayer.destroy();
    youtubePlayer = null;
  }

  videoEnded = false;
  isPlaying = false;

  // DON'T include overlay in innerHTML - use persistent one
  display.innerHTML = `
    <div style="position: relative; width: 100%; max-width: 900px; margin: 0 auto;">
      <div id="youtube-player-${videoId}" style="width: 100%; aspect-ratio: 16/9;"></div>
      ${item.title ? `<div class="mt-4 text-center text-gray-700 text-lg font-semibold">${item.title}</div>` : ''}
    </div>
  `;

  // Initialize player...
  const initPlayer = () => {
    if (youtubeApiReady && window.YT && window.YT.Player) {
      try {
        youtubePlayer = new window.YT.Player(`youtube-player-${videoId}`, {
          videoId: videoId,
          playerVars: { /* ... */ },
          events: {
            onStateChange: (event) => {
              if (event.data === 0) {
                console.log('Video ended, showing overlay');
                videoEnded = true;
                isPlaying = false;

                // Update persistent overlay content
                const overlayTitle = document.getElementById('overlay-title');
                if (overlayTitle) {
                  overlayTitle.textContent = item.title || 'Video Complete';
                }

                // Show persistent overlay
                const overlay = document.getElementById('video-end-overlay');
                if (overlay) {
                  overlay.style.display = 'flex';
                }
              }
            }
          }
        });
      } catch (error) {
        console.error('Error creating YouTube player:', error);
      }
    } else {
      setTimeout(initPlayer, 100);
    }
  };

  setTimeout(initPlayer, 100);
}
```

**Setup Event Listeners Once (outside displayItem):**

```javascript
// At page load, setup persistent overlay buttons
const replayBtnPersistent = document.getElementById('replay-btn-persistent');
const nextBtnPersistent = document.getElementById('next-btn-persistent');

if (replayBtnPersistent) {
  replayBtnPersistent.addEventListener('click', () => {
    console.log('Replay clicked');
    if (youtubePlayer) {
      youtubePlayer.seekTo(0);
      youtubePlayer.playVideo();
      videoEnded = false;

      // Hide overlay
      const overlay = document.getElementById('video-end-overlay');
      if (overlay) overlay.style.display = 'none';
    }
  });
}

if (nextBtnPersistent) {
  nextBtnPersistent.addEventListener('click', () => {
    console.log('Next clicked');
    videoEnded = false;

    // Hide overlay
    const overlay = document.getElementById('video-end-overlay');
    if (overlay) overlay.style.display = 'none';

    // Navigate
    if (currentIndex < currentItems.length - 1) {
      goToNext();
    } else {
      displayItem(0); // Loop to start
    }
  });
}
```

**Why This Works:**

✅ Overlay is direct child of `#content-wrapper` (inside fullscreen container)
✅ Not recreated on every navigation (persistent)
✅ Event listeners attached once, work in both fullscreen and normal mode
✅ DOM structure compatible with browser's top layer
✅ Z-index works correctly (overlay is sibling to content, not nested)

**Testing:**
- [ ] Normal mode: Overlay appears when video ends
- [ ] Normal mode: Replay button works
- [ ] Normal mode: Next button works
- [ ] **Fullscreen mode: Overlay appears when video ends**
- [ ] **Fullscreen mode: Replay button is CLICKABLE**
- [ ] **Fullscreen mode: Next button is CLICKABLE**
- [ ] Multiple replays: Overlay shows again after replay

**Problem:** After clicking Replay once, overlay doesn't appear when video ends again

**Root Cause:**

The replay button handler removes the overlay class but doesn't properly reset state:

```javascript
// Current code (BUGGY):
replayBtn.addEventListener('click', () => {
  youtubePlayer.seekTo(0);
  youtubePlayer.playVideo();
  videoEnded = false;
  document.getElementById('video-overlay').classList.remove('active');
  // ↑ This removes the class, but what if overlay was recreated?
});
```

**Issues:**
1. Overlay is recreated every time `displayItem()` is called
2. Old event listeners are lost
3. Class toggle might not work on newly created element
4. State (`videoEnded`) and DOM (`classList`) might be out of sync

**Fix (Already solved by Fix #5):**

By using a **persistent overlay** (Fix #5), we:
- ✅ Don't recreate overlay on navigation
- ✅ Keep event listeners intact
- ✅ State and DOM stay in sync
- ✅ Simple show/hide with `display: flex` / `display: none`

**Verification:**
```javascript
// In onStateChange when video ends:
if (event.data === 0) {
  videoEnded = true;
  const overlay = document.getElementById('video-end-overlay');
  if (overlay) {
    overlay.style.display = 'flex';  // Show
    console.log('Overlay shown, videoEnded:', videoEnded);
  }
}

// In replay button click:
replayBtnPersistent.addEventListener('click', () => {
  videoEnded = false;
  const overlay = document.getElementById('video-end-overlay');
  if (overlay) {
    overlay.style.display = 'none';  // Hide
    console.log('Overlay hidden, videoEnded:', videoEnded);
  }
  youtubePlayer.seekTo(0);
  youtubePlayer.playVideo();
});
```

**Testing:**
- [ ] Video ends → overlay shows (first time) ✅
- [ ] Click Replay → overlay hides ✅
- [ ] Video plays to end again → **overlay shows again** ✅ (was failing before)
- [ ] Click Replay again → overlay hides ✅
- [ ] Repeat 5 times → overlay always shows/hides correctly ✅

#### Enhancement #2: Add Timeline Scrubbing Controls to recursive-landing

**File:** `recursive-landing/view.html`

**What's Possible with YouTube Player API:**

✅ **Fully Possible:**
1. Skip forward/backward buttons (±10 seconds)
2. Custom progress bar with click-to-seek
3. Display current time / total duration
4. Keyboard shortcuts (arrow keys to seek)

❌ **Not Recommended:**
- Full native-style timeline (complex, many edge cases)
- Thumbnail previews (requires additional API calls)

**Recommended Implementation: Simple Skip Buttons**

**Add to Video Controls HTML (after play/pause button):**

```html
<!-- Skip Backward Button -->
<button id="skip-backward-btn" style="
  width: 48px;
  height: 48px;
  border-radius: 50%;
  background: #4b5563;
  border: none;
  cursor: pointer;
  display: flex;
  align-items: center;
  justify-content: center;
  transition: all 0.3s;
" onmouseover="this.style.background='#374151'" onmouseout="this.style.background='#4b5563'">
  <svg style="width: 24px; height: 24px; color: white;" fill="currentColor" viewBox="0 0 24 24">
    <path d="M11 18V6l-8.5 6 8.5 6zm.5-6l8.5 6V6l-8.5 6z"/>
  </svg>
  <text style="position: absolute; font-size: 10px; color: white; font-weight: bold; margin-top: 2px;">10</text>
</button>

<!-- Play/Pause (already exists) -->

<!-- Skip Forward Button -->
<button id="skip-forward-btn" style="
  width: 48px;
  height: 48px;
  border-radius: 50%;
  background: #4b5563;
  border: none;
  cursor: pointer;
  display: flex;
  align-items: center;
  justify-content: center;
  transition: all 0.3s;
" onmouseover="this.style.background='#374151'" onmouseout="this.style.background='#4b5563'">
  <svg style="width: 24px; height: 24px; color: white;" fill="currentColor" viewBox="0 0 24 24">
    <path d="M13 6v12l8.5-6L13 6zM4 18l8.5-6L4 6v12z"/>
  </svg>
  <text style="position: absolute; font-size: 10px; color: white; font-weight: bold; margin-top: 2px;">10</text>
</button>
```

**Add Event Listeners:**

```javascript
// Skip backward 10 seconds
const skipBackwardBtn = document.getElementById('skip-backward-btn');
if (skipBackwardBtn) {
  skipBackwardBtn.addEventListener('click', () => {
    if (!youtubePlayer) return;
    const currentTime = youtubePlayer.getCurrentTime();
    youtubePlayer.seekTo(Math.max(0, currentTime - 10), true);
  });
}

// Skip forward 10 seconds
const skipForwardBtn = document.getElementById('skip-forward-btn');
if (skipForwardBtn) {
  skipForwardBtn.addEventListener('click', () => {
    if (!youtubePlayer) return;
    const currentTime = youtubePlayer.getCurrentTime();
    const duration = youtubePlayer.getDuration();
    youtubePlayer.seekTo(Math.min(duration, currentTime + 10), true);
  });
}

// Keyboard shortcuts
document.addEventListener('keydown', (e) => {
  if (!youtubePlayer) return;

  // Left arrow = -10 seconds
  if (e.key === 'ArrowLeft') {
    e.preventDefault();
    const currentTime = youtubePlayer.getCurrentTime();
    youtubePlayer.seekTo(Math.max(0, currentTime - 10), true);
  }

  // Right arrow = +10 seconds
  if (e.key === 'ArrowRight') {
    e.preventDefault();
    const currentTime = youtubePlayer.getCurrentTime();
    const duration = youtubePlayer.getDuration();
    youtubePlayer.seekTo(Math.min(duration, currentTime + 10), true);
  }

  // Spacebar = play/pause
  if (e.key === ' ' || e.key === 'Spacebar') {
    e.preventDefault();
    if (isPlaying) {
      youtubePlayer.pauseVideo();
    } else {
      youtubePlayer.playVideo();
    }
  }
});
```

**Optional: Custom Progress Bar (More Advanced)**

If you want a clickable progress bar:

```html
<!-- Progress Bar -->
<div id="progress-container" style="
  width: 100%;
  max-width: 600px;
  height: 8px;
  background: #e5e7eb;
  border-radius: 4px;
  cursor: pointer;
  margin-top: 12px;
  position: relative;
">
  <div id="progress-bar" style="
    height: 100%;
    background: #9333ea;
    border-radius: 4px;
    width: 0%;
    transition: width 0.1s linear;
  "></div>
</div>
```

```javascript
// Update progress bar every 100ms
setInterval(() => {
  if (youtubePlayer && youtubePlayer.getCurrentTime) {
    const current = youtubePlayer.getCurrentTime();
    const duration = youtubePlayer.getDuration();
    const percentage = (current / duration) * 100;

    const progressBar = document.getElementById('progress-bar');
    if (progressBar) {
      progressBar.style.width = percentage + '%';
    }
  }
}, 100);

// Click to seek
const progressContainer = document.getElementById('progress-container');
if (progressContainer) {
  progressContainer.addEventListener('click', (e) => {
    if (!youtubePlayer) return;

    const rect = progressContainer.getBoundingClientRect();
    const clickX = e.clientX - rect.left;
    const percentage = clickX / rect.width;
    const duration = youtubePlayer.getDuration();
    const seekTime = duration * percentage;

    youtubePlayer.seekTo(seekTime, true);
  });
}
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Simple skip buttons (easy to implement, works great)
- ✅ Keyboard shortcuts for power users
- ✅ Optional progress bar for visual feedback
- ✅ All controls accessible on mobile
- ✅ No complex timeline logic needed

**Testing After Implementation:**
- [ ] Click skip buttons → video jumps 10 seconds
- [ ] Press arrow keys → video seeks
- [ ] Press spacebar → video plays/pauses
- [ ] Click progress bar → video seeks to that position
- [ ] Time display updates every second

#### Fix #3: Content Area Bottom Cut-Off

**Files:** Both `SequenceViewer.tsx` and `view.html`

**Investigation Steps:**
1. Inspect container heights in browser dev tools
2. Check if page indicators or controls are overlapping content
3. Verify padding/margin settings
4. Test with different aspect ratios (images vs videos)

**Possible Causes:**
- Viewer container height calculation
- Page indicator positioning (absolute bottom)
- Control buttons overlapping content
- Content-container min-height too small

**Fix Location (SequenceViewer.tsx:214-383):**
Check main container structure and CSS classes

**Fix Location (view.html:66-75, 106-117):**
Check content-container and page-indicator CSS

**Once Root Cause Found:**
- Adjust container height
- Or adjust page indicator bottom position
- Or add padding-bottom to content area
- Ensure no overlapping elements

---

#### Fix #4: Restore Fullscreen Button in recursive-creator

**File:** `recursive-creator/components/viewers/SequenceViewer.tsx`

**Current Location (lines 385-408):**
```tsx
{/* Controls Overlay - bottom */}
<div className="absolute bottom-0 left-0 right-0 p-6 flex items-center justify-between pointer-events-none">
  {/* Page Counter */}
  <div className="bg-black/70 text-white px-4 py-2 rounded-full text-sm backdrop-blur-sm pointer-events-auto">
    {currentIndex + 1} / {items.length}
  </div>

  {/* Fullscreen Button - Large touch target */}
  <button
    onClick={toggleFullscreen}
    className="pointer-events-auto w-14 h-14 bg-black/70 hover:bg-black/80 backdrop-blur-sm rounded-full flex items-center justify-center transition-all"
    aria-label={isFullscreen ? 'Exit fullscreen' : 'Enter fullscreen'}
  >
    {/* SVG icons */}
  </button>
</div>
```

**Problem:** This code exists but button not showing - why?

**Investigation:**
1. Check if element is being rendered (React DevTools)
2. Check CSS - is it hidden by another element?
3. Check z-index conflicts
4. Check if parent container has `overflow: hidden`
5. Check if `pointer-events-none` on parent is causing issues

**Possible Fixes:**
- Increase z-index on controls overlay
- Remove `overflow: hidden` from parent containers
- Ensure button is outside any clipping containers
- Add explicit `z-index: 50` to controls div

**Quick Fix to Try:**
```tsx
{/* Controls Overlay - bottom */}
<div className="absolute bottom-0 left-0 right-0 p-6 flex items-center justify-between z-50">
  {/* Ensure z-index higher than video player */}
```

### 🐛 NEW ISSUES FOUND

**Issue #7: YouTube Logo Link Visible in recursive-landing** 🔴 HIGH PRIORITY
- **Problem:** YouTube logo and link are visible in the player
- **User Report:** "The Youtube logo and link is available, so that when one clicks it opens the video on Youtube in a new page... Can we make even that not appear?"
- **Impact:** Breaks "bounded experience" - users can escape to YouTube
- **Root Cause:** `modestbranding=1` only minimizes branding, doesn't remove it completely
- **File:** `recursive-landing/view.html`
- **Solution:** Add `modestbranding=1` is already there, but YouTube logo still appears with controls=0. Need to investigate if there's a way to hide it or if it's a YouTube policy requirement.

**Issue #8: Fullscreen Button Still Not Visible in recursive-creator** 🔴 CRITICAL
- **Problem:** Fullscreen button not appearing despite z-50 fix
- **User Report:** "Is there a coded full screen button on the react? i still dont see it and I did not see any changes on how it is rendered"
- **File:** `recursive-creator/components/viewers/SequenceViewer.tsx`
- **Deployed Commit:** 311856a added z-50
- **Possible Causes:**
  1. Build/deployment issue - changes not deployed to preview?
  2. Z-index conflict with other elements
  3. Parent container clipping the controls
  4. CSS class not applying correctly
- **Debug Steps:**
  1. Verify deployment has latest code
  2. Inspect element in browser DevTools
  3. Check if element exists in DOM
  4. Check computed styles (z-index, visibility, opacity)
  5. Check parent container overflow/clipping

**Issue #9: YouTube Shorts URLs Incorrectly Converted to Drive URLs** 🔴 HIGH PRIORITY
- **Problem:** YouTube Shorts URLs are being treated as Drive URLs
- **User Report:**
  - Initial link: `https://youtube.com/shorts/FTxe-Nl9BLA`
  - Final (wrong): `https://drive.google.com/file/d/https://youtube.com/shorts/FTxe-Nl9BLA/view`
- **Impact:** Video doesn't render, creator experience broken
- **Root Cause:** URL parsing logic incorrectly identifying Shorts URLs
- **File:** `recursive-creator/app/dashboard/sequences/new/page.tsx` (bulk URL processing)
- **Fix Needed:** Add YouTube Shorts detection to URL validation/parsing

---

### Console Errors (Non-Critical)

**Expected/Benign Errors:**
- ✅ `postMessage` origin mismatch (YouTube API normal behavior)
- ✅ Grammarly extension violations (browser extension, not our code)
- ✅ CORS errors from Google ads (expected, YouTube tracking blocked)
- ✅ Missing favicon (cosmetic)
- ✅ Spiral functions not found (site-shell component, doesn't affect viewer)

**Action:** No fixes needed for console errors - all are expected or third-party

---

### Phase 11E: Additional Fixes Needed

**Priority Order:**
1. **Fix #8** - DEBUG fullscreen button visibility (CRITICAL - 30 min investigation)
2. **Fix #9** - Fix YouTube Shorts URL parsing (HIGH - 20 min)
3. **Fix #7** - Hide/minimize YouTube logo (HIGH - 30 min investigation)

---

#### Fix #7: Hide YouTube Logo Link

**File:** `recursive-landing/view.html`

**Current Parameters:**
```javascript
playerVars: {
  rel: 0,
  modestbranding: 1,  // ← Already set, but logo still appears
  enablejsapi: 1,
  controls: 0,
  fs: 0,
  iv_load_policy: 3
}
```

**Research Needed:**
According to YouTube documentation, `modestbranding=1` only *minimizes* the YouTube logo, it doesn't remove it completely. YouTube's terms of service may require logo visibility.

**Possible Solutions:**

**Option A: CSS Overlay to Hide Logo**
```css
/* Add to <style> section */
#viewer-container iframe[src*="youtube"] {
  /* YouTube logo typically in top-right corner */
}

/* May need to add overlay div covering logo area */
```

**Option B: Accept YouTube Logo (ToS Compliance)**
- YouTube's ToS may require logo visibility
- Check official documentation
- If required, explain to user that logo must stay for compliance

**Option C: Increase Player Size to Push Logo Out**
- Make player larger than container
- Use `overflow: hidden` to clip logo area
- Risky - may violate ToS

**Investigation Steps:**
1. Check YouTube IFrame API ToS for logo requirements
2. Test CSS-based hiding (if allowed)
3. Document findings and recommend compliant solution

**Decision Needed:** Check if hiding YouTube logo violates ToS before implementing

#### Fix #8: Debug Fullscreen Button Not Visible

**File:** `recursive-creator/components/viewers/SequenceViewer.tsx`

**Code That Should Be Working (Line 386):**
```tsx
<div className="absolute bottom-0 left-0 right-0 p-6 flex items-center justify-between pointer-events-none z-50">
  <div className="bg-black/70 text-white px-4 py-2 rounded-full text-sm backdrop-blur-sm pointer-events-auto">
    {currentIndex + 1} / {items.length}
  </div>

  <button
    onClick={toggleFullscreen}
    className="pointer-events-auto w-14 h-14 bg-black/70 hover:bg-black/80 backdrop-blur-sm rounded-full flex items-center justify-center transition-all"
    aria-label={isFullscreen ? 'Exit fullscreen' : 'Enter fullscreen'}
  >
    {/* SVG icons */}
  </button>
</div>
```

**Debug Checklist:**

1. **Verify Deployment**
   ```bash
   # Check latest commit on preview URL
   # Should show commit 311856a
   ```

2. **Browser DevTools Inspection**
   - Open browser inspector
   - Find element with class "absolute bottom-0 left-0 right-0"
   - Check if it exists in DOM
   - Check computed styles:
     - `z-index: 50` applied?
     - `display: flex` applied?
     - `visibility: visible`?
     - `opacity: 1`?

3. **Check Parent Container**
   - Look for parent with `overflow: hidden`
   - Check if parent has lower z-index
   - Verify positioning context

4. **Possible Fixes:**

**Fix A: Increase Z-Index Further**
```tsx
<div className="absolute bottom-0 left-0 right-0 p-6 flex items-center justify-between pointer-events-none z-[100]">
```

**Fix B: Remove Pointer Events None from Parent**
```tsx
<div className="absolute bottom-0 left-0 right-0 p-6 flex items-center justify-between z-50">
  {/* Remove pointer-events-none, add to individual children */}
```

**Fix C: Move Outside Flex Container**
Check if parent flex container is causing issues - may need to restructure DOM

**Fix D: Add Important Flag**
```tsx
<div className="absolute bottom-0 left-0 right-0 p-6 flex items-center justify-between !z-50">
```

#### Fix #9: YouTube Shorts URL Parsing

**File:** `recursive-creator/app/dashboard/sequences/new/page.tsx`

**Problem:** YouTube Shorts URLs being treated as Drive URLs

**Current URL Patterns Supported:**
```typescript
// From extractYouTubeId function
const patterns = [
  /(?:youtube\.com\/watch\?v=|youtu\.be\/)([^&\n?#]+)/,
  /^([a-zA-Z0-9_-]{11})$/  // Direct video ID
];
```

**Missing Pattern:** YouTube Shorts
```
https://youtube.com/shorts/VIDEO_ID
https://www.youtube.com/shorts/VIDEO_ID
```

**Fix:**

**Step 1: Update extractYouTubeId function**
```typescript
function extractYouTubeId(url: string): string | null {
  const patterns = [
    /(?:youtube\.com\/watch\?v=|youtu\.be\/)([^&\n?#]+)/,
    /youtube\.com\/shorts\/([^&\n?#]+)/,  // ← ADD THIS
    /^([a-zA-Z0-9_-]{11})$/
  ];

  for (const pattern of patterns) {
    const match = url.match(pattern);
    if (match && match[1]) {
      return match[1];
    }
  }
  return null;
}
```

**Step 2: Update Bulk URL Processing**

Find where URLs are being parsed (likely in handleBulkAdd or similar):

```typescript
// Current logic (WRONG):
if (url.includes('drive.google.com')) {
  // Process as Drive URL
} else if (url.includes('youtube.com') || url.includes('youtu.be')) {
  // Process as YouTube
}

// Updated logic (CORRECT):
const youtubeId = extractYouTubeId(url);
if (youtubeId) {
  // It's a YouTube video (includes Shorts)
  addVideoItem(youtubeId);
} else if (url.includes('drive.google.com')) {
  // It's a Drive URL
  addDriveItem(url);
}
```

**Step 3: Test with All YouTube URL Formats**
- Regular: `https://youtube.com/watch?v=VIDEO_ID`
- Short: `https://youtu.be/VIDEO_ID`
- Shorts: `https://youtube.com/shorts/VIDEO_ID`
- Mobile: `https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=VIDEO_ID`
- Direct ID: `VIDEO_ID` (11 characters)

**Testing:**
- [ ] Paste Shorts URL → extracted as YouTube video
- [ ] Video renders correctly (Shorts are just regular videos with different UI on YouTube)
- [ ] Drive URLs still work correctly
- [ ] Regular YouTube URLs still work
