# Context for Claude Code: Recursive Creator Project

> **Last Updated:** 2025-11-04 (Session 5)
> **Current Phase:** Phase 0 COMPLETE - Auth Fully Working (All Email Providers) ✅
> **Next Session:** Copy auth to other projects, then move to Phase 1 (features)

---

## Project Overview

**Name:** Recursive Creator
**Purpose:** Unified creator hub for Recursive.eco ecosystem
**Domain:** creator.recursive.eco (future)
**Stack:** Next.js 15 + React 19 + Supabase + TypeScript

**What We're Building:**
1. **Story Publisher** - Parents upload images to create children's books
2. **Playlist Wrapper** - Curated YouTube playlists for kids (privacy-enhanced)
3. **Account Hub** - Unified dashboard for all Recursive.eco content

---

## Key Decision: Auth First! ✅

**Decision Made:** Build dual auth (magic link + OTP) BEFORE fun features

**Rationale:**
- Magic links fail on non-Gmail providers
- 3-4 days of auth work saves weeks of frustration
- No refactoring needed later
- Copy pattern to all projects immediately (channels, journal)
- Solid foundation for testing dashboard features

**Timeline:**
- Days 1-4: Implement dual auth
- Days 5+: Build stories, playlists, etc.

---

## Key Decision: Full JSONB Schema ✅

**Decision Made:** Use JSONB-heavy approach (like existing projects)

**Rationale:**
- Small scale (200 users max) → JSONB is plenty fast
- Solo dev → speed > perfect structure
- Infrequent querying → no need for complex optimization
- Claude builds visualizations → don't need Supabase Studio
- **Better for AI features** → JSON format is native for LLMs, embeddings, etc.
- No migrations needed → iterate fast

**See:** `SIMPLE_JSONB_SCHEMA.md` for full schema (3 tables, dead simple)

## Architecture Decisions

### 1. Hybrid Approach (React + Vanilla-Style Viewers)

**Question Resolved:** "Does vanilla HTML have more creative freedom?"

**Answer:** No - it's mostly psychological. React can render identical HTML/CSS/JS.

**Solution:**
- Use Next.js dynamic routes (for auth checks)
- Render vanilla-style components (same UX as recursive-landing)
- Best of both worlds: auth checks + creative freedom

### 2. Private/Unlisted/Public Content

**Requirement:** Users need to preview stories before publishing

**Solution:**
- Server-side permission checks in Next.js routes
- Visibility options: private (owner only), unlisted (anyone with link), public (everyone)
- Preview mode shows unpublished content to owner

### 3. Auth Portability

**Requirement:** Copy auth to channels and journal projects

**Solution:**
- All projects share same Supabase instance
- Copy 4 files, update Supabase email template once
- Works across all projects in ~50 minutes
- See: `AUTH_PORTABILITY.md`

## Technical Context

### Supabase Connection

**Project:** Shared across all Recursive.eco apps
**URL:** https://yoursrpohfbpxoalyoeg.supabase.co (check .env)

**Existing Tables:**
- `channels` - Wellness/creative/learning channels
- `tools` - Community tools (JSONB-heavy, keep as-is)
- `profiles` - User profiles (JSONB-heavy, keep as-is)
- `journal_templates` - Journaling prompts
- `user_documents` - Generic user data (JSONB-heavy, keep as-is)
- `newsletter_subscribers` - Email signups

**New Tables (To Create):**
- `stories` - Story metadata (relational design)
- `story_pages` - Individual story pages
- `playlists` - Playlist metadata (relational design)
- `playlist_items` - Individual videos
- `user_stars` - Cross-project starred content

**Schema Location:** `z.Supabase/schema_20251030.sql`

### Auth Setup

**Current Status:** ✅ Dual auth implemented + bugs fixed

**Implementation Complete:**
1. ✅ `DualAuth.tsx` component (two-step flow: email → OTP)
2. ✅ Auth callback route (`app/auth/callback/route.ts`)
3. ✅ Error page with OTP fallback (`app/auth/error/page.tsx`)
4. ✅ **CRITICAL BUG FIXED:** Cookie domain configuration

**Remaining:**
1. ⏳ Update Supabase email template (include `{{ .Token }}`)
2. ⏳ Test across email providers and environments

**See:** `AUTH_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` for complete code

## Session 3-4 Updates: Auth Debugging Journey

### Bug #1: Cookie Domain Configuration (Fixed - Best Practice)

**Initial Problem:**
Hardcoded `domain: '.recursive.eco'` doesn't work on localhost or Vercel previews.

**Solution:**
Environment-aware cookie configuration:
```typescript
const isProduction = hostname.endsWith('recursive.eco');
const cookieDomain = isProduction ? '.recursive.eco' : undefined;
```

**Files:** `lib/supabase-client.ts`, `lib/supabase-server.ts`

### Bug #2: CRITICAL - Wrong Callback Logic (ACTUAL ROOT CAUSE)

**The Real Problem (discovered via Vercel logs):**
```
❌ Missing token_hash or type in callback
fullUrl: 'https://creator.recursive.eco/auth/callback?code=af540734-95db-4ab9-ba31-3283f66cc36e'
```

Supabase was sending a `code` parameter (PKCE flow), but the callback was ONLY looking for `token_hash` + `type`.

**Why This Happened:**
- I wrote callback logic from scratch instead of copying from recursive-channels-fresh
- recursive-channels-fresh handles BOTH flows (old magic link + new PKCE)
- I only implemented the old flow

**Solution:**
Copied EXACT callback logic from recursive-channels-fresh:

```typescript
// Handle magic link tokens (old flow)
if (token_hash && type === 'magiclink') {
  await supabase.auth.verifyOtp({ token_hash, type: 'magiclink' })
}

// Handle PKCE code exchange (new flow) ← THIS WAS MISSING!
if (code) {
  await supabase.auth.exchangeCodeForSession(code)
}
```

**File:** `app/auth/callback/route.ts`

**Key Lesson:** ALWAYS copy working code from recursive-channels-fresh as the reference implementation!

### Dark Mode Implementation

**All auth pages converted to dark theme:**
- `app/page.tsx` - Main landing page (bg-gray-900)
- `components/auth/DualAuth.tsx` - Auth form (bg-gray-800 cards)
- `app/auth/error/page.tsx` - Error page (dark theme + OTP input)

**Design choices:**
- Background: `bg-gray-900` (main page), `bg-gray-800` (cards)
- Text: `text-white` (headings), `text-gray-400` (body)
- Inputs: `bg-gray-700` with `border-gray-600`
- Success/Error messages: Semi-transparent backgrounds with colored borders
- Buttons: Blue primary (`bg-blue-600`) for consistency

### OTP Fallback on Error Page

**New functionality added to `/auth/error`:**
- Initial view shows error message + "Enter 6-Digit Code" button
- Clicking button reveals full OTP verification form
- Form includes email input + OTP input (6 digits)
- Successfully verifies and logs user in if OTP is valid
- Provides fallback if magic link fails

**User flow:**
1. Magic link fails → redirected to `/auth/error`
2. User sees error explanation + OTP option
3. User clicks "Enter 6-Digit Code"
4. User enters email + 6-digit code from email
5. System verifies OTP → redirects to dashboard

**File:** `app/auth/error/page.tsx` - Now client component with state management

---

## Session 5 Updates: Corporate Email & Supabase Configuration

### The Final Auth Issue: 403 Forbidden on OTP Verification

**Problem:** After implementing dual auth, Gmail worked perfectly but corporate email (Pepsico/Outlook) failed with:
```
POST https://evixjvagwjmjdjpbazuj.supabase.co/auth/v1/verify 403 (Forbidden)
```

### Discovery Process:

**Initial Theory: Outlook SafeLinks Breaking Auth**
- Corporate emails wrap links in SafeLinks: `https://nam12.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=...`
- This breaks PKCE flow because code_verifier cookie gets lost through the redirect chain
- ✅ This explained why magic links failed
- ❌ But didn't explain why OTP also failed (OTP bypasses callbacks entirely!)

**Key Insight: Testing on Multiple Devices**
- Tried OTP on corporate computer → 403 error
- Tried OTP on personal computer → **SAME 403 error!**
- This ruled out corporate firewall/security as the cause

**The Root Cause: Supabase "Confirm Email" Setting**

When "Confirm Email" is ENABLED in Supabase:
1. **First-time users** get "Confirm your signup" email (NO OTP code)
2. Must click confirmation link to activate account
3. **Only then** can use OTP for future logins
4. If user exists but is UNCONFIRMED → OTP returns 403 Forbidden

**What Was Happening:**
- Gmail user: Already confirmed (from earlier testing) → OTP worked ✅
- Pepsico user: Created while email confirmation was ON → stuck in unconfirmed state → OTP failed ❌

### The Solution:

**Step 1: Disable Email Confirmation**
- Go to Supabase Dashboard → Authentication → Providers → Email
- Set **"Enable email confirmation"** to **OFF**
- Rationale: OTP already verifies email ownership, no need for separate confirmation

**Step 2: Delete & Recreate Unconfirmed Users**
- Users created BEFORE disabling confirmation are stuck with `email_confirmed_at: null`
- Must delete these users from Supabase Dashboard → Authentication → Users
- User signs up again → now works immediately with OTP

### Critical Supabase Configuration for Dual Auth:

**Authentication → Providers → Email:**
- ✅ Enable email provider: **ON**
- ✅ Confirm email: **OFF** (critical for OTP-only flow)

**Authentication → URL Configuration:**
- Site URL: `https://creator.recursive.eco`
- Redirect URLs:
  - `https://creator.recursive.eco/auth/callback`
  - `https://*.vercel.app/auth/callback`
  - `http://localhost:3001/auth/callback`

**Email Templates → Magic Link:**
Must include BOTH magic link AND OTP code:
```html
<h2>Sign in to Recursive.eco</h2>
<p><strong>Option 1: Click to sign in</strong></p>
<p><a href="{{ .ConfirmationURL }}">Sign in to Recursive.eco</a></p>

<p><strong>Option 2: Enter this code</strong></p>
<p style="font-size: 32px; font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: 8px; font-family: monospace;">
  {{ .Token }}
</p>
```

### Why Corporate Email Still Works with OTP:

**Magic Link Flow (Broken by SafeLinks):**
1. Supabase generates: `https://supabase.co/auth/v1/verify?token=pkce_...&redirect_to=creator.recursive.eco`
2. Outlook wraps it: `https://safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=...`
3. User clicks → goes through Outlook's server first
4. PKCE code_verifier cookie lost in redirect chain
5. Callback receives code but no verifier → fails ❌

**OTP Flow (Works Perfectly):**
1. User receives 6-digit code in email
2. Types code directly in browser (on creator.recursive.eco)
3. Browser → Supabase API directly (no redirects, no callbacks, no cookies needed)
4. Supabase verifies code → creates session → success ✅

### Debugging Added (Console Logs):

Added comprehensive logging to help diagnose OTP issues:

```typescript
console.log('🔢 Attempting OTP verification:', { email, otpLength, otpValue })
console.log('🔢 OTP verification response:', { success, error, hasSession })
```

**Files updated:**
- `components/auth/DualAuth.tsx` - OTP verification with logging
- `app/auth/error/page.tsx` - Error page OTP with logging

### Testing Status:

✅ **Gmail** - Magic link + OTP both work
✅ **Corporate Email (Outlook/Pepsico)** - OTP works (magic link expected to fail)
✅ **Dark mode** implemented across all auth pages
✅ **Auto-prefilled email** on error page via sessionStorage
✅ **PKCE + Magic Link** flows both supported in callback

### Key Lessons Learned:

1. **Supabase email confirmation MUST be disabled for OTP-only flows**
2. **Corporate email SafeLinks break magic links** - OTP is the solution
3. **403 errors often mean "user not confirmed"** not "wrong credentials"
4. **Always check Supabase Dashboard → Users** to see confirmation status
5. **Vercel logs show server-side (callbacks)**, **Browser console shows client-side (OTP)**

### Code to Copy TO Other Projects:
When copying auth to recursive-channels-fresh and jongu-tool-best-possible-self:
1. ✅ `app/auth/callback/route.ts` - Already matches channels (we copied FROM there!)
2. ⚠️ `lib/supabase-client.ts` - Copy environment-aware version TO channels
3. ⚠️ `lib/supabase-server.ts` - Copy environment-aware version TO channels
4. ⚠️ `components/auth/DualAuth.tsx` - Copy dual auth TO channels
5. ⚠️ `app/auth/error/page.tsx` - Copy error page with OTP TO channels

**IMPORTANT:** The callback route here is now identical to recursive-channels-fresh (we copied it). The ONLY improvements to share are:
- Environment-aware cookies

## Quick Start (Resuming Development)

### If Starting Fresh Session:

**Step 1: Read Context (5 min)**
- Read this file (CLAUDE.md)
- Skim PROJECT_PLAN.md
- Check "Current State" section above

**Step 2: Check Phase**
- Look at "Current State" → what's done, what's next
- If Phase 0 (auth): Read AUTH_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md
- If Phase 1+ (features): Read PROJECT_PLAN.md

**Step 3: Ask User**
- "Ready to continue with [current task]?"
- Confirm any decisions if unclear

**Step 4: Continue**
- Pick up where we left off
- Use TodoWrite to track progress
- Update this file when major decisions are made

### If User Says "Continue" or "Let's go":
- Check "Next Steps" in "Current State" section
- Start with first unchecked task
- Create todos with TodoWrite
- Begin implementation

---

## Important Notes


### Always Do:
- ✅ Use TodoWrite for multi-step tasks
- ✅ Mark todos complete as you finish
- ✅ Copy proven patterns (don't reinvent)
- ✅ Test across email providers (Gmail, Outlook, etc.)
- ✅ Ask for clarification if ambiguous

### Code Style:
- TypeScript (strict mode)
- Tailwind CSS (utility-first)
- Server components by default (use 'use client' when needed)
- Descriptive variable names
- Comments for complex logic

---

## Debugging Tips

### If Auth Issues:

**1. Check Vercel Logs FIRST!**
- Go to Vercel Dashboard → Project → Logs → Real-time
- Look for auth callback logs with 🔐 emoji
- Check what parameters Supabase is sending: `code`, `token_hash`, or `type`?
- This tells you which flow Supabase is using

**2. Common Auth Failures:**

**"Missing token_hash or type"** → Callback not handling PKCE flow
- Supabase sends `code` parameter (PKCE)
- Callback needs `exchangeCodeForSession(code)`
- Solution: Copy callback from recursive-channels-fresh

**"Token has expired or is invalid"** → Multiple possible causes
- Check Vercel logs for actual error
- Could be expired link (1 hour timeout)
- Could be wrong redirect URL in Supabase
- Could be cookie domain issues

**"Code exchange failed"** → Redirect URL mismatch
- Check Supabase Dashboard → Authentication → URL Configuration
- Ensure callback URLs are whitelisted for your domain
- Need: `https://creator.recursive.eco/auth/callback`

**3. Cookie Domain Check:**
- Browser dev tools → Application → Cookies
- localhost should have NO domain attribute
- production should have `domain=.recursive.eco`
- Look for cookies like `sb-*-auth-token`

**4. Test Both Auth Methods:**
- Click magic link (should redirect to /dashboard)
- If that fails, use OTP on error page
- OTP bypasses the callback flow entirely

### If Database Issues:
- Check RLS policies (common source of "no rows" errors)
- Verify foreign keys exist
- Look at Supabase logs in dashboard
- Test queries in SQL Editor

### If Build Issues:
- Check Next.js version (15.4.3)
- Verify all imports
- Check middleware.ts path config
- Clear .next folder and rebuild

- Update "Current State" section
- Update "Next Steps"
- Add any new decisions/context
- Increment "Last Updated" date

---

## Current Session Context (Session 3)

**Date:** 2025-11-03
**Focus:** Debug auth failures + implement dark mode + OTP fallback
**Accomplishments:**
- ✅ Diagnosed root cause: cookie domain configuration bug
- ✅ Fixed cookie domain logic in client + server files
- ✅ Converted all auth pages to dark mode
- ✅ Added OTP input fallback to error page
- ✅ Dev server tested locally (port 3001)

**What User Needs to Do Next:**
1. **Update Supabase Email Template** (see template below)
2. Test auth flow locally with real email
3. Deploy to Vercel and test on production domain
4. If working, copy auth pattern to other projects

**Supabase Email Template (Magic Link + OTP):**

Go to: Supabase Dashboard → Authentication → Email Templates → Magic Link

```html
<h2>Sign in to Recursive.eco</h2>

<p>Click the link below to sign in:</p>
<p><a href="{{ .ConfirmationURL }}">Sign In</a></p>

<p><strong>Or enter this 6-digit code:</strong></p>
<p style="font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold; font-family: monospace;">{{ .Token }}</p>

<p style="font-size: 12px; color: #666;">
  This code expires in 1 hour.<br>
  If you didn't request this, you can safely ignore it.
</p>
```

**Key:** The `{{ .Token }}` variable includes the 6-digit OTP code

**Redirect URLs to Whitelist in Supabase:**
- Local: `http://localhost:3001/auth/callback`
- Preview: `https://*.vercel.app/auth/callback`
- Production: `https://creator.recursive.eco/auth/callback`

**Current Development Server:**
- Running on port 3001 (port 3000 was in use)
- Access at: http://localhost:3001
- Ready for testing with updated email template

---

## Questions to Ask User (If Resuming and Unclear)

1. "What phase are we on?" (Check Current State)
2. "Should I continue with [next task]?" (Check Next Steps)
3. "Any decisions changed since last session?" (Validate context)
4. "Ready to start implementation?" (Get confirmation)

**If user says "continue," "let's go," or similar:**
→ Check Next Steps, create todos, start work!

---

## Quick Reference: What Changed in Sessions 3-4

### Files Modified:
1. `lib/supabase-client.ts` - Environment-aware cookie domain (best practice)
2. `lib/supabase-server.ts` - Environment-aware cookie domain (best practice)
3. `app/page.tsx` - Dark mode (bg-gray-900)
4. `components/auth/DualAuth.tsx` - Dark mode + sessionStorage for email
5. `app/auth/error/page.tsx` - Dark mode + OTP form + auto-prefilled email
6. `app/auth/callback/route.ts` - **CRITICAL FIX:** Now handles PKCE code exchange

### Critical Bug Fixed:
**Missing PKCE Code Handler** - Supabase sends `code` parameter (PKCE flow), but callback only handled `token_hash` + `type` (old magic link flow). Fixed by copying EXACT callback logic from recursive-channels-fresh which handles BOTH flows.

### How We Found It:
Vercel logs showed:
```
fullUrl: '...?code=af540734-95db-4ab9-ba31-3283f66cc36e'
❌ Missing token_hash or type in callback
```

This revealed callback was ignoring the `code` parameter completely.

### Features Added:
1. **Dark mode** across all auth pages
2. **OTP fallback** with sessionStorage email prefill
3. **Environment-aware cookies** (localhost, Vercel, production)
4. **PKCE code exchange** support (the missing piece!)

### Testing Status:
- ✅ All code matches working recursive-channels-fresh
- ✅ Supabase email template includes `{{ .Token }}`
- ⏳ Awaiting production test (should work now!)

### Next Session:
- Test auth on https://creator.recursive.eco/
- If working, copy improvements to other projects
- Start Phase 1 (story publisher features)
