# feedback from user

Actually, can you make it so that the user can save a draft without a title?

ANd the box with the URL to Published project to appear below the button of publishing as the user would not know where to find it. 


THe numbered approach almost worked! You need to enlarge the link box to fit the numbered frame. Right now it is about haf the size

## Project Overview

**Name:** Recursive Creator
**Purpose:** Forge tools for collective meaning-making
**Domain:** creator.recursive.eco (future)
**Stack:** Next.js 15 + React 19 + Supabase + TypeScript

## Who This Is For (The Vulcan Vision) 🔨

**PlayfulProcess = Vulcan, Regent of Taurus (Ascendant)**

*"I build tools for the gods. I want cultural change through popularizing digital culture, creating a collective, giving people the right tools so they can create."*

### Not a Traditional Developer
- **Social worker** (MSW starting 2026) who vibe codes
- **Activist/Artist** following Tillich + Vanessa Andreotti + Bayo Akomolafe (Hospicing Modernity)
- **Toolmaker for the collective**, not platform builder for self
- Cares about **art/activism/spirituality** > software optimization
- **Process over outcome**, **beauty over efficiency**

### The Mission: Gateway Building, Not Gatekeeping
- Build the **forge** (upload tools, frameworks, infrastructure)
- **People** use the forge to **create** (stories, wellness tools, contemplations)
- Creations **feed back** to the collective (channels)
- **Cultural change** through popularized digital creation

### The Recursive Loop:
```
PlayfulProcess builds tools
  ↓
Parents create children's stories
  ↓
Stories published to Kids Stories channel
  ↓
Other families use & are inspired
  ↓
More people create tools & content
  ↓
Collective grows through participation
  ↓
LOOP: Cultural change emerges
```

**This is infrastructure for collective meaning-making, not a personal portfolio.**

## What We're Building (Tools for the Collective)

1. **Content Sequence Creator** - Parents/creators upload image stories + curated YouTube playlists with narrative context
   - Stories: Image sequences with text (children's books, visual narratives)
   - Playlists: YouTube videos wrapped in safer, calmer UX with narrative pauses
   - **Unified Viewer**: Both use same beautiful viewer (images + videos mixed together)

2. **YouTube Wrapper Value** - Why wrap playlists instead of using native YouTube?
   - 🎭 **Narrative Context**: Add story pages before/after videos, create "chapters"
   - 🧹 **Clean Embeds**: Hide related videos, remove search, no autoplay chaos
   - 🛡️ **Safer for Kids**: Bounded experience, can't click away to random videos
   - 💬 **Community Reviews**: Trusted recommendations within recursive.eco (future)

3. **Account Hub** - Unified dashboard for all Recursive.eco content
4. **Future: Existential Tarot** - Contemplation tool (Tillich meets digital culture, ontoject path)
5. **Future: AI Contemplation Limits** - Introspection prompts after 10 AI attempts (hospicing modernity practice)

## Key Decision: Auth First! ✅

**Decision Made:** Build dual auth (magic link + OTP) BEFORE fun features

**Rationale:**
- Magic links fail on non-Gmail providers
- 3-4 days of auth work saves weeks of frustration
- No refactoring needed later
- Copy pattern to all projects immediately (channels, journal)
- Solid foundation for testing dashboard features

**Timeline:**
- Days 1-4: Implement dual auth
- Days 5+: Build stories, playlists, etc.

---

## Key Decision: Full JSONB Schema ✅

**Decision Made:** Use JSONB-heavy approach (like existing projects)

**Rationale:**
- Small scale (200 users max) → JSONB is plenty fast
- Solo dev → speed > perfect structure
- Infrequent querying → no need for complex optimization
- Claude builds visualizations → don't need Supabase Studio
- **Better for AI features** → JSON format is native for LLMs, embeddings, etc.
- No migrations needed → iterate fast

**See:** `SIMPLE_JSONB_SCHEMA.md` for full schema (3 tables, dead simple)

## Architecture Decisions

### 1. Iframe-Based Story Viewer (DECIDED 2025-11-09) ✅

**Question:** Should we convert recursive-landing's story viewer to React or use iframe?

**Answer:** Use iframe! Much better for the Vulcan vision.

**Why (Toolmaker Perspective):**
- ✅ **Creators see EXACT final beauty** while editing (WYSIWYG - gods deserve this)
- ✅ Zero conversion effort (vanilla JS → React is 4-6 hours wasted on internal tooling)
- ✅ All features work perfectly: fullscreen, swipe, keyboard, wheel
- ✅ Update viewer once, benefits both forge and public display
- ✅ Less code to maintain = more time for art/activism/spirituality
- ✅ 100% reliable vs 10-20% chance direct copy would work
- ✅ **Non-technical creators** (parents) see their creation come alive immediately

**Solution:**
- **recursive-creator**: The forge - simple upload tool with embedded iframe preview
- **recursive-landing**: The gallery - beautiful viewer where all stories live publicly
- **Communication**: URL params (`?story_id=123&preview=true`)
- **Philosophy**: Separate creation tool (utilitarian) from display (artistic)

### 2. Story Viewer Architecture

**Upload Tool (recursive-creator/dashboard/stories/new):**
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Story Upload Form                   │
│ - Title                            │
│ - Subtitle                         │
│ - Upload images (drag & drop)      │
│ - Reorder pages                    │
│                                    │
│ [Save Draft] [Preview] [Publish]   │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘

When clicking [Preview]:
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│ LIVE PREVIEW (iframe)               │
│ ┌─────────────────────────────────┐ │
│ │ https://recursive.eco/pages/    │ │
│ │ stories/viewer.html              │ │
│ │ ?story_id=123&preview=true       │ │
│ │                                 │ │
│ │ [Story loads from Supabase]     │ │
│ └─────────────────────────────────┘ │
│                                    │
│ ← Back to Edit    [Publish Now]    │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Viewer (recursive-landing/pages/stories/viewer.html):**
```javascript
// Support both local files AND Supabase
const storyId = urlParams.get('story_id');  // NEW: Supabase ID
const storySlug = urlParams.get('story');   // Existing: local file
const isPreview = urlParams.get('preview'); // NEW: draft mode

if (storyId) {
  // Fetch from Supabase
  const { data } = await supabase
    .from('stories')
    .select('*, story_pages(*)')
    .eq('id', storyId);

  // If preview mode, check user owns it
  if (isPreview) {
    // Verify current user is owner
  }
} else if (storySlug) {
  // Existing: fetch local JSON
  const response = await fetch(`${storySlug}/story.json`);
}
```

### 3. Unified Content Viewer Architecture (DECIDED 2025-11-11) ✅

**Question:** Should stories and playlists have separate viewers, or one unified viewer?

**Answer:** Unified viewer! Both are just sequences of content.

**Why (Toolmaker Perspective):**
- ✅ **Same essence**: Stories = image sequences, Playlists = video sequences
- ✅ **Future-proof**: Can mix images + videos in same sequence later
- ✅ **One codebase**: Update viewer once, benefits all content types
- ✅ **Consistent UX**: Users learn one interface, works for everything
- ✅ **Mobile-optimized**: Responsive design for both images and videos
- ✅ **Solves CORS**: Iframe loads from recursive.eco domain (not creator.recursive.eco)

**Solution:**
- **recursive-landing dev branch**: Build unified content viewer at `dev.recursive.eco`
- **Viewer features**: Fullscreen, swipe, keyboard nav, wheel scroll (existing)
- **Video support**: YouTube nocookie embeds (rel=0, modestbranding=1)
- **Supabase integration**: Fetch content via `?id=uuid&type=story|playlist`
- **Clean YouTube UX**: Hide recommendations, no search, bounded experience

**Data Structure (Keep Separate for MVP):**
```json
{
  "document_type": "story" | "playlist",
  "document_data": {
    "pages": [...],    // For stories
    "videos": [...]    // For playlists
  }
}
```

**Future Enhancement (Unified Items Array):**
```json
{
  "document_type": "sequence",
  "document_data": {
    "items": [
      { "type": "image", "image_url": "...", "text": "..." },
      { "type": "video", "video_id": "...", "title": "..." },
      { "type": "image", "image_url": "...", "text": "..." }
    ]
  }
}
```

**Development Workflow:**
1. Create `dev-unified-viewer` branch in recursive-landing
2. Copy `pages/stories/viewer.html` → `pages/content/viewer.html`
3. Add video support + Supabase client
4. Deploy dev branch to `dev.recursive.eco`
5. Update recursive-creator preview iframes to point to dev viewer
6. Test Drive/Imgur images + YouTube videos
7. Merge to main when stable

**YouTube Wrapper Benefits:**
1. 🎭 **Narrative Context** - Add story pages between videos
2. 🧹 **Clean Embeds** - No related videos at end (youtube-nocookie.com)
3. 🛡️ **Safer for Kids** - Can't navigate to random YouTube content
4. 💬 **Community Reviews** - Trusted recommendations (future)

### 4. Design Philosophy: Forges for Mortals

**The Vulcan Principle:** Tools must be simple enough for non-technical creators to wield.

**Design Constraints for All Forges:**
- ✅ **< 10 minutes** to create something meaningful
- ✅ **No technical jargon** - labels a parent understands
- ✅ **Immediate preview** - see beauty come alive
- ✅ **Forgiving UX** - mistakes are easy to fix
- ✅ **Optional complexity** - advanced features hidden until needed
- ✅ **Mobile-friendly** - create on phone while kids nap
- ✅ **Inspiring** - using the tool feels playful, not bureaucratic

**Anti-patterns to Avoid:**
- ❌ Dev-focused UI (no "deploy," use "publish")
- ❌ Multi-step wizards (everything on one screen if possible)
- ❌ Hidden features (preview always visible)
- ❌ Overwhelming options (start simple, add complexity later)
- ❌ Ugly internal tools (even forges deserve beauty)

**The Test:**
Could a parent who's never coded before create a story for their child in under 10 minutes, while feeling inspired rather than frustrated?

If no → simplify the forge.

### 4. Visibility & Access (Donations-Only Philosophy)

**Requirement:** Gateway building, not gatekeeping

**Solution:**
- Visibility in story_data JSONB: `"visibility": "public"` or `"private"`
- NO paywalls - all published stories accessible to everyone
- Optional donation prompts (gentle, not pushy)
- Creators own their content
- Preview mode for drafts (creator sees before publishing)
- RLS policies enforce creator-only editing, public viewing

### 3. Auth Portability

**Requirement:** Copy auth to channels and journal projects

**Solution:**
- All projects share same Supabase instance
- Copy 4 files, update Supabase email template once
- Works across all projects in ~50 minutes
- See: `AUTH_PORTABILITY.md`

## Technical Context

### Supabase Connection

**Project:** Shared across all Recursive.eco apps
**URL:** https://yoursrpohfbpxoalyoeg.supabase.co (check .env)

**Existing Tables:**
- `channels` - Wellness/creative/learning channels
- `tools` - Community tools (JSONB-heavy, keep as-is)
- `profiles` - User profiles (JSONB-heavy, keep as-is)
- `journal_templates` - Journaling prompts
- `user_documents` - Generic user data (JSONB-heavy, keep as-is)
- `newsletter_subscribers` - Email signups

**New Tables (To Create for Phase 1):**

Using **JSONB-heavy approach** for simplicity (see SIMPLE_JSONB_SCHEMA.md):

```sql
-- Stories (everything in JSONB)
CREATE TABLE stories (
  id uuid PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
  slug text UNIQUE NOT NULL,
  story_data jsonb DEFAULT '{}'::jsonb,
  created_at timestamptz DEFAULT now()
);

CREATE INDEX idx_stories_creator ON stories ((story_data->>'creator_id'));
CREATE INDEX idx_stories_visibility ON stories ((story_data->>'visibility'));

-- Story pages (minimal structure)
CREATE TABLE story_pages (
  id uuid PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
  story_id uuid REFERENCES stories(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  page_number integer NOT NULL,
  page_data jsonb DEFAULT '{}'::jsonb,
  created_at timestamptz DEFAULT now(),
  UNIQUE(story_id, page_number)
);

-- RLS Policies
ALTER TABLE stories ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE story_pages ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

CREATE POLICY "Anyone can view public published stories"
  ON stories FOR SELECT
  USING (
    story_data->>'visibility' = 'public'
    AND story_data->>'published' = 'true'
  );

CREATE POLICY "Users can view their own stories"
  ON stories FOR SELECT
  USING (story_data->>'creator_id' = auth.uid()::text);

CREATE POLICY "Users can create stories"
  ON stories FOR INSERT
  WITH CHECK (story_data->>'creator_id' = auth.uid()::text);

CREATE POLICY "Users can update their own stories"
  ON stories FOR UPDATE
  USING (story_data->>'creator_id' = auth.uid()::text);

CREATE POLICY "Users can delete their own stories"
  ON stories FOR DELETE
  USING (story_data->>'creator_id' = auth.uid()::text);

CREATE POLICY "Story pages visible to story viewers"
  ON story_pages FOR SELECT
  USING (
    EXISTS (
      SELECT 1 FROM stories
      WHERE stories.id = story_pages.story_id
      AND (
        (story_data->>'visibility' = 'public' AND story_data->>'published' = 'true')
        OR story_data->>'creator_id' = auth.uid()::text
      )
    )
  );

CREATE POLICY "Users can manage their story pages"
  ON story_pages FOR ALL
  USING (
    EXISTS (
      SELECT 1 FROM stories
      WHERE stories.id = story_pages.story_id
      AND story_data->>'creator_id' = auth.uid()::text
    )
  );

-- Storage bucket for story images
INSERT INTO storage.buckets (id, name, public)
VALUES ('story-images', 'story-images', true)
ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING;
```

**story_data structure:**
```json
{
  "title": "The Nest Knows Best",
  "subtitle": "For Little Ones Learning to Sleep",
  "author": "PlayfulProcess",
  "cover_image_url": "story-images/user-id/story-id/cover.png",
  "visibility": "private",
  "published": false,
  "creator_id": "user-uuid-here"
}
```

**page_data structure:**
```json
{
  "image_url": "story-images/user-id/story-id/page-1.png",
  "alt_text": "Bunny sitting under a tree",
  "narration": "Once upon a time..."
}
```

**Future Tables (Phase 2):**
- `playlists` table (same JSONB approach)

**Schema Location:** See `SIMPLE_JSONB_SCHEMA.md` for complete copy-paste ready schema

### Auth Setup

**Current Status:** ✅ Dual auth implemented + bugs fixed

**Implementation Complete:**
1. ✅ `DualAuth.tsx` component (two-step flow: email → OTP)
2. ✅ Auth callback route (`app/auth/callback/route.ts`)
3. ✅ Error page with OTP fallback (`app/auth/error/page.tsx`)
4. ✅ **CRITICAL BUG FIXED:** Cookie domain configuration

**Remaining:**
1. ⏳ Update Supabase email template (include `{{ .Token }}`)
2. ⏳ Test across email providers and environments

**See:** `AUTH_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` for complete code

---

## Session 3-4 Updates: Auth Debugging Journey

### Bug #1: Cookie Domain Configuration (Fixed - Best Practice)

**Initial Problem:**
Hardcoded `domain: '.recursive.eco'` doesn't work on localhost or Vercel previews.

**Solution:**
Environment-aware cookie configuration:
```typescript
const isProduction = hostname.endsWith('recursive.eco');
const cookieDomain = isProduction ? '.recursive.eco' : undefined;
```

**Files:** `lib/supabase-client.ts`, `lib/supabase-server.ts`

### Bug #2: CRITICAL - Wrong Callback Logic (ACTUAL ROOT CAUSE)

**The Real Problem (discovered via Vercel logs):**
```
❌ Missing token_hash or type in callback
fullUrl: 'https://creator.recursive.eco/auth/callback?code=af540734-95db-4ab9-ba31-3283f66cc36e'
```

Supabase was sending a `code` parameter (PKCE flow), but the callback was ONLY looking for `token_hash` + `type`.

**Why This Happened:**
- I wrote callback logic from scratch instead of copying from recursive-channels-fresh
- recursive-channels-fresh handles BOTH flows (old magic link + new PKCE)
- I only implemented the old flow

**Solution:**
Copied EXACT callback logic from recursive-channels-fresh:

```typescript
// Handle magic link tokens (old flow)
if (token_hash && type === 'magiclink') {
  await supabase.auth.verifyOtp({ token_hash, type: 'magiclink' })
}

// Handle PKCE code exchange (new flow) ← THIS WAS MISSING!
if (code) {
  await supabase.auth.exchangeCodeForSession(code)
}
```

**File:** `app/auth/callback/route.ts`

**Key Lesson:** ALWAYS copy working code from recursive-channels-fresh as the reference implementation!

### Dark Mode Implementation

**All auth pages converted to dark theme:**
- `app/page.tsx` - Main landing page (bg-gray-900)
- `components/auth/DualAuth.tsx` - Auth form (bg-gray-800 cards)
- `app/auth/error/page.tsx` - Error page (dark theme + OTP input)

**Design choices:**
- Background: `bg-gray-900` (main page), `bg-gray-800` (cards)
- Text: `text-white` (headings), `text-gray-400` (body)
- Inputs: `bg-gray-700` with `border-gray-600`
- Success/Error messages: Semi-transparent backgrounds with colored borders
- Buttons: Blue primary (`bg-blue-600`) for consistency

### OTP Fallback on Error Page

**New functionality added to `/auth/error`:**
- Initial view shows error message + "Enter 6-Digit Code" button
- Clicking button reveals full OTP verification form
- Form includes email input + OTP input (6 digits)
- Successfully verifies and logs user in if OTP is valid
- Provides fallback if magic link fails

**User flow:**
1. Magic link fails → redirected to `/auth/error`
2. User sees error explanation + OTP option
3. User clicks "Enter 6-Digit Code"
4. User enters email + 6-digit code from email
5. System verifies OTP → redirects to dashboard

**File:** `app/auth/error/page.tsx` - Now client component with state management

## Session 5 Updates: Corporate Email & Supabase Configuration

### The Final Auth Issue: 403 Forbidden on OTP Verification

**Problem:** After implementing dual auth, Gmail worked perfectly but corporate email (Pepsico/Outlook) failed with:
```
POST https://evixjvagwjmjdjpbazuj.supabase.co/auth/v1/verify 403 (Forbidden)
```

### Discovery Process:

**Initial Theory: Outlook SafeLinks Breaking Auth**
- Corporate emails wrap links in SafeLinks: `https://nam12.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=...`
- This breaks PKCE flow because code_verifier cookie gets lost through the redirect chain
- ✅ This explained why magic links failed
- ❌ But didn't explain why OTP also failed (OTP bypasses callbacks entirely!)

**Key Insight: Testing on Multiple Devices**
- Tried OTP on corporate computer → 403 error
- Tried OTP on personal computer → **SAME 403 error!**
- This ruled out corporate firewall/security as the cause

**The Root Cause: Supabase "Confirm Email" Setting**

When "Confirm Email" is ENABLED in Supabase:
1. **First-time users** get "Confirm your signup" email (NO OTP code)
2. Must click confirmation link to activate account
3. **Only then** can use OTP for future logins
4. If user exists but is UNCONFIRMED → OTP returns 403 Forbidden

**What Was Happening:**
- Gmail user: Already confirmed (from earlier testing) → OTP worked ✅
- Pepsico user: Created while email confirmation was ON → stuck in unconfirmed state → OTP failed ❌

### The Solution:

**Step 1: Disable Email Confirmation**
- Go to Supabase Dashboard → Authentication → Providers → Email
- Set **"Enable email confirmation"** to **OFF**
- Rationale: OTP already verifies email ownership, no need for separate confirmation

**Step 2: Delete & Recreate Unconfirmed Users**
- Users created BEFORE disabling confirmation are stuck with `email_confirmed_at: null`
- Must delete these users from Supabase Dashboard → Authentication → Users
- User signs up again → now works immediately with OTP

### Critical Supabase Configuration for Dual Auth:

**Authentication → Providers → Email:**
- ✅ Enable email provider: **ON**
- ✅ Confirm email: **OFF** (critical for OTP-only flow)

**Authentication → URL Configuration:**
- Site URL: `https://creator.recursive.eco`
- Redirect URLs:
  - `https://creator.recursive.eco/auth/callback`
  - `https://*.vercel.app/auth/callback`
  - `http://localhost:3001/auth/callback`

**Email Templates → Magic Link:**
Must include BOTH magic link AND OTP code:
```html
<h2>Sign in to Recursive.eco</h2>
<p><strong>Option 1: Click to sign in</strong></p>
<p><a href="{{ .ConfirmationURL }}">Sign in to Recursive.eco</a></p>

<p><strong>Option 2: Enter this code</strong></p>
<p style="font-size: 32px; font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: 8px; font-family: monospace;">
  {{ .Token }}
</p>
```

### Why Corporate Email Still Works with OTP:

**Magic Link Flow (Broken by SafeLinks):**
1. Supabase generates: `https://supabase.co/auth/v1/verify?token=pkce_...&redirect_to=creator.recursive.eco`
2. Outlook wraps it: `https://safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=...`
3. User clicks → goes through Outlook's server first
4. PKCE code_verifier cookie lost in redirect chain
5. Callback receives code but no verifier → fails ❌

**OTP Flow (Works Perfectly):**
1. User receives 6-digit code in email
2. Types code directly in browser (on creator.recursive.eco)
3. Browser → Supabase API directly (no redirects, no callbacks, no cookies needed)
4. Supabase verifies code → creates session → success ✅

### Debugging Added (Console Logs):

Added comprehensive logging to help diagnose OTP issues:

```typescript
console.log('🔢 Attempting OTP verification:', { email, otpLength, otpValue })
console.log('🔢 OTP verification response:', { success, error, hasSession })
```

**Files updated:**
- `components/auth/DualAuth.tsx` - OTP verification with logging
- `app/auth/error/page.tsx` - Error page OTP with logging

### Testing Status:

✅ **Gmail** - Magic link + OTP both work
✅ **Corporate Email (Outlook/Pepsico)** - OTP works (magic link expected to fail)
✅ **Dark mode** implemented across all auth pages
✅ **Auto-prefilled email** on error page via sessionStorage
✅ **PKCE + Magic Link** flows both supported in callback

### Key Lessons Learned:

1. **Supabase email confirmation MUST be disabled for OTP-only flows**
2. **Corporate email SafeLinks break magic links** - OTP is the solution
3. **403 errors often mean "user not confirmed"** not "wrong credentials"
4. **Always check Supabase Dashboard → Users** to see confirmation status
5. **Vercel logs show server-side (callbacks)**, **Browser console shows client-side (OTP)**

## Quick Start (Resuming Development)

### If Starting Fresh Session:

**Step 1: Read Context (5 min)**
- Read this file (CLAUDE.md)
- Skim PROJECT_PLAN.md
- Check "Current State" section above

**Step 2: Check Phase**
- Look at "Current State" → what's done, what's next
- If Phase 0 (auth): Read AUTH_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md
- If Phase 1+ (features): Read PROJECT_PLAN.md

**Step 3: Ask User**
- "Ready to continue with [current task]?"
- Confirm any decisions if unclear

**Step 4: Continue**
- Pick up where we left off
- Use TodoWrite to track progress
- Update this file when major decisions are made

### If User Says "Continue" or "Let's go":
- Check "Next Steps" in "Current State" section
- Start with first unchecked task
- Create todos with TodoWrite
- Begin implementation

---

## Important Notes


### Always Do:
- ✅ Use TodoWrite for multi-step tasks
- ✅ Mark todos complete as you finish
- ✅ Copy proven patterns (don't reinvent)
- ✅ Test across email providers (Gmail, Outlook, etc.)
- ✅ Ask for clarification if ambiguous

### Code Style:
- TypeScript (strict mode)
- Tailwind CSS (utility-first)
- Server components by default (use 'use client' when needed)
- Descriptive variable names
- Comments for complex logic

---

## Debugging Tips

### If Auth Issues:

**1. Check Vercel Logs FIRST!**
- Go to Vercel Dashboard → Project → Logs → Real-time
- Look for auth callback logs with 🔐 emoji
- Check what parameters Supabase is sending: `code`, `token_hash`, or `type`?
- This tells you which flow Supabase is using

**2. Common Auth Failures:**

**"Missing token_hash or type"** → Callback not handling PKCE flow
- Supabase sends `code` parameter (PKCE)
- Callback needs `exchangeCodeForSession(code)`
- Solution: Copy callback from recursive-channels-fresh

**"Token has expired or is invalid"** → Multiple possible causes
- Check Vercel logs for actual error
- Could be expired link (1 hour timeout)
- Could be wrong redirect URL in Supabase
- Could be cookie domain issues

**"Code exchange failed"** → Redirect URL mismatch
- Check Supabase Dashboard → Authentication → URL Configuration
- Ensure callback URLs are whitelisted for your domain
- Need: `https://creator.recursive.eco/auth/callback`

**3. Cookie Domain Check:**
- Browser dev tools → Application → Cookies
- localhost should have NO domain attribute
- production should have `domain=.recursive.eco`
- Look for cookies like `sb-*-auth-token`

**4. Test Both Auth Methods:**
- Click magic link (should redirect to /dashboard)
- If that fails, use OTP on error page
- OTP bypasses the callback flow entirely

### If Database Issues:
- Check RLS policies (common source of "no rows" errors)
- Verify foreign keys exist
- Look at Supabase logs in dashboard
- Test queries in SQL Editor

### If Build Issues:
- Check Next.js version (15.4.3)
- Verify all imports
- Check middleware.ts path config
- Clear .next folder and rebuild

## Current Session Context (Session 11 - Phase 7 Implementation & Deployment)

**Date:** 2025-11-13
**Focus:** Implement Drive folder batch upload, deploy to Vercel, fix bugs

### What We Accomplished:

**Phase 7: Drive Folder Import** ✅ COMPLETE
- Created backend API route `/api/import-drive-folder`
- Uses Google Drive API v3 with API key (no OAuth needed!)
- Filters for images and videos, sorts alphabetically by filename
- Frontend: Added "📁 Import Folder" button + modal
- Auto-populates bulk textarea with imported URLs
- Works with publicly shared Drive folders
- **Implementation time:** ~2 hours (as estimated)

**Deployment to Vercel** ✅
- Merged dev → main, force pushed to trigger deployment
- Fixed old commit issue (was deploying 58 commits behind!)
- Domain configuration verified (creator.recursive.eco)
- Deployed commit: b7e2aff
- **Status:** Live and working in production!

**Bug Fixes Based on User Feedback** ✅
1. **Save button:** Added better error validation and logging
2. **Alphabetical sorting:** Imported files now sorted by filename
3. **CSP errors:** Documented as expected (Google Drive security)

**Testing Results:**
- ✅ Drive folder import working
- ✅ Alphabetical sorting working
- ✅ Save button working
- ✅ All features tested and confirmed by user

**Key Files:**
- `/app/api/import-drive-folder/route.ts` - Backend API (133 lines)
- `/app/dashboard/sequences/new/page.tsx` - Frontend UI updates
- **Commits:** 03a95a6 (Phase 7), d6e0dd3 (trigger deploy), b7e2aff (bug fixes)

**Environment Variables Needed:**
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
- `GOOGLE_DRIVE_API_KEY` (new!)

**Lessons Learned:**
- Vercel can deploy old commits if not monitored carefully
- Public Drive folders don't require OAuth (huge simplification!)
- Force redeploy: empty commit or Vercel dashboard
- CSP errors for Google Drive framing are expected and normal

## Previous Session Context (Session 10 - Phase 6 Cleanup & Drive Folder Research)

**Date:** 2025-11-13
**Focus:** Clean up unused stories/playlists code, research Gmail/Drive folder batch upload feature

### What We Completed:

**Phase 6 Cleanup** ✅
- Removed all unused stories and playlists code from dashboard
- Deleted `/dashboard/stories/new/page.tsx` (replaced by sequences)
- Deleted `/dashboard/playlists/new/page.tsx` (replaced by sequences)
- Removed Story and Playlist TypeScript interfaces
- Removed stories/playlists state variables and fetch functions
- Removed dashboard JSX sections for stories and playlists
- Updated `getStatusBadge()` to use Sequence type
- **Result:** Dashboard now shows only "My Projects" (sequences section)
- **Removed:** 1,150 lines of unused code
- **Build:** Tested and passing ✅
- **Committed:** 47e220a - "Phase 6 cleanup: Remove unused stories and playlists code"

**Drive Folder Batch Upload Research** ✅
- Researched Google Drive API v3 for folder file listing
- **Key Finding:** Public folders DON'T require OAuth! (Can use API key only)
- **Implementation Estimate:** 2-3 hours (not 2-3 days as initially thought)
- **Documented in:** PROJECT_PLAN.md Phase 7
- **User Need:** Currently tedious to add 10+ images (must share each file individually)
- **Solution:** Paste ONE folder link, app extracts all file URLs automatically

**Technical Approach Documented:**
- Backend API route: `/api/import-drive-folder`
- Google Drive API v3 with API key (read-only)
- Filter files by mimeType (images + videos)
- Convert to direct URLs (Drive format: `uc?export=view&id=FILE_ID`)
- Auto-populate bulk textarea for review before import
- **Limitation:** Only works with publicly shared folders
- **Priority:** Medium (nice-to-have, not critical)

**Next Steps:**
- Phase 6 testing on Vercel (user tests)
- Optionally implement Phase 7 (Drive folder import) if desired

## Previous Session Context (Session 9 - Unified Sequence Creator Implementation)

**Date:** 2025-11-12
**Focus:** Build unified sequence creator (mix images + videos), mobile-first viewer, NO database changes

**Major Accomplishment:** Completed Phases 1-4 of unified sequence creator!

### What We Built:

**Phase 1: Backend (NO DB CHANGES!)** ✅
- Use existing `document_type: 'creative_work'` (already in database)
- Identify sequences with `tool_slug: 'sequence'`
- Zero migrations needed - works with existing schema!

**Phase 2: Unified Creator UI** ✅
- Created `/dashboard/sequences/new` - mix images AND videos
- **Dropdown menu:** Add Image or Add Video
- Type-specific inputs (alt text for images, title for videos)
- Auto-convert Drive URLs → `uc?export=view&id=FILE_ID` format ✅ (user confirmed working!)
- Auto-extract YouTube video IDs from any URL format
- Reorder items with up/down arrows
- Live thumbnails for both types
- Proxy wrapping for CORS on Drive images

**Phase 3: Mobile-First React Viewer** ✅
- Created `/components/viewers/SequenceViewer.tsx`
- **Design principle:** "If you can swipe through it like Instagram stories, it's simple enough"
- Primary interaction: **Swipe left/right** (mobile)
- Secondary: Keyboard arrows (desktop)
- Large touch targets (56px buttons) - avoid hamburger menu issues
- Minimal UI: page counter + fullscreen button at bottom
- No complex overlays or menus in viewer
- YouTube nocookie embeds with clean UI (`rel=0`, `modestbranding=1`)
- Site header/navigation unchanged (hamburger stays for site nav)

**Phase 4: Dashboard Integration** ✅
- Added "My Sequences" section to dashboard (top, green highlight)
- Fetch sequences: `tool_slug='sequence'` + `document_type='creative_work'`
- Create/Edit/Delete functionality
- Shows item count, date, status badges
- Old stories/playlists sections still exist (safety net for Phase 6 testing)

**Key Technical Decisions:**
1. **NO database changes** - use existing creative_work type
2. **Mobile-first viewer** - gestures > buttons, avoid touch issues
3. **Test before cleanup** - keep old tools until sequences proven working
4. **Drive format that works:** `https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=FILE_ID`

**Drive URL Fix (Session 9 start):**
- Reset to bc6a9f9, then updated to use `uc?export=view` format
- Removed Imgur references (focus on Drive)
- User confirmed: "The google links are working!"

**Current State:**
- **Phases 1-4:** Complete and pushed to dev
- **Phase 5:** Pending - cleanup old story/playlist files
- **Phase 6:** Pending - testing on Vercel
- **Strategy:** Test first, cleanup after (safety net approach)

**Files Created:**
- `/app/dashboard/sequences/new/page.tsx` - Unified creator (562 lines)
- `/components/viewers/SequenceViewer.tsx` - Mobile-first viewer (229 lines)

**Files Modified:**
- `/app/dashboard/page.tsx` - Added sequences section
- `/app/api/proxy-image/route.ts` - Removed Imgur, kept Drive
- `/PROJECT_PLAN.md` - Documented full plan with 6 phases

**Next Steps (Phase 6 Testing):**
1. ✅ Commit and push to dev
2. ✅ Update CLAUDE.md
3. ⏳ User tests on Vercel
4. ⏳ Verify Drive images load through proxy
5. ⏳ Verify YouTube embeds work
6. ⏳ Test mobile swipe navigation
7. ⏳ If all good → Phase 5 cleanup (remove old files)
8. ⏳ If issues → debug with safety net (old code still exists)

## Previous Session Context (Session 8 - Unified Viewer Architecture)

**Date:** 2025-11-11
**Focus:** Pivot from Supabase Storage to URL-based approach, build YouTube playlist creator, plan unified viewer

**Previous Session Summary (Session 7):**
- ✅ Built story/playlist upload forges with URL-based storage (no file uploads!)
- ✅ Added Google Drive URL auto-conversion
- ✅ Created YouTube playlist wrapper with video embeds
- ✅ Added 'playlist' to document_types (migration 002-add-playlist-type.sql)
- ✅ Dashboard shows both stories and playlists

**Session 8 Accomplishments:**
- ✅ **PIVOTED from Supabase Storage to URL-based approach** (Session 7)
  - Users provide image URLs (Google Drive, Imgur, etc.)
  - No hosting costs, users own their data
  - Auto-converts Drive sharing links to direct image URLs
- ✅ **Built YouTube playlist creator** (`/dashboard/playlists/new`) (Session 7)
  - Auto-extracts video IDs from any YouTube URL format
  - YouTube nocookie embeds (privacy-enhanced)
  - Same approval workflow as stories
- ✅ **Auto-show preview after saving** (Session 8)
  - Preview automatically appears with `setShowPreview(true)`
  - WYSIWYG experience for creators
- ✅ **Investigated image rendering issues** (Session 8)
  - No old Supabase Storage code found (completely URL-based)
  - CORS issues with Drive/Imgur likely cause of rendering failures
  - Iframe approach should solve this
- ✅ **UNIFIED VIEWER ARCHITECTURE DECIDED** (Session 8)
  - Stories + playlists merge into one content viewer
  - Both are just "sequences of content" (images vs videos)
  - Build in recursive-landing dev branch, iframe from creator
- ✅ **Built unified content viewer** (`recursive-landing/pages/content/viewer.html`)
  - Supports both Supabase (`?id=uuid&type=story|playlist`) and local JSON (`?story=slug`)
  - Auto-detects content type: renders images OR videos
  - YouTube nocookie embeds with `rel=0`, `modestbranding=1`
  - All existing features: fullscreen, swipe, keyboard, wheel navigation
  - 480 lines of vanilla JS with Supabase client integration
- ✅ **Updated recursive-creator preview iframes**
  - Story preview: Points to `dev.recursive.eco/pages/content/viewer.html?id={id}&type=story`
  - Playlist preview: Points to `dev.recursive.eco/pages/content/viewer.html?id={id}&type=playlist`
  - Replaced ~105 lines of inline preview code with ~12 lines of iframe
  - Cleaner codebase, single source of truth for rendering
- ✅ **Deployed dev branch to dev.recursive.eco**
  - Dev branch `dev-unified-viewer` created and pushed
  - Production stays stable on main branch
  - Ready for testing

**Key Insight:**
Both stories and playlists are **sequences of content**. Instead of separate viewers:
- One unified viewer handles images AND videos
- YouTube wrapper provides: narrative context, clean embeds, safer UX, community reviews
- Future: Mix images + videos in same sequence (story page → video → story page)

**YouTube Wrapper Value Proposition:**
1. 🎭 **Narrative Context** - Add story pages before/after videos as "chapters"
2. 🧹 **Clean YouTube Embeds** - Hide related videos (youtube-nocookie.com, rel=0)
3. 🛡️ **Safer for Kids** - Bounded experience, can't navigate away
4. 💬 **Community Reviews** - Trusted recommendations (future)

**Session 8 Testing Instructions (PLEASE TEST!):**

The unified viewer architecture is complete and deployed to `dev.recursive.eco`. Here's what to test:

**Test 1: Story Creation with Drive/Imgur Images**
1. Go to `creator.recursive.eco/dashboard/stories/new`
2. Create a new story with:
   - Title: "Test Story"
   - Subtitle: "Testing Drive/Imgur images"
   - Author: Your name
3. Add pages with image URLs from:
   - Google Drive (sharing link format)
   - Imgur (direct link)
   - Any other image hosting service
4. Click "Save New Draft"
5. **Check:** Does the preview automatically appear? ✅/❌
6. **Check:** Do the images render correctly in the preview iframe? ✅/❌
7. **Check:** Can you navigate between pages (swipe, arrows, keyboard)? ✅/❌
8. **Check:** Does fullscreen mode work? ✅/❌

**Test 2: Playlist Creation with YouTube Videos**
1. Go to `creator.recursive.eco/dashboard/playlists/new`
2. Create a new playlist with:
   - Title: "Test Playlist"
   - Description: "Testing YouTube embeds"
   - Category: "Kids"
3. Add videos with various YouTube URL formats:
   - `https://youtube.com/watch?v=VIDEO_ID`
   - `https://youtu.be/VIDEO_ID`
   - Direct video ID: `VIDEO_ID`
4. Click "Save Playlist"
5. **Check:** Does the preview automatically appear? ✅/❌
6. **Check:** Do the videos embed correctly? ✅/❌
7. **Check:** Are related videos hidden (clean YouTube UX)? ✅/❌
8. **Check:** Can you navigate between videos? ✅/❌

**Test 3: CORS Issue Resolution**
1. Use a Google Drive image that previously failed to render
2. Create a story with that image
3. **Check:** Does it render in the iframe preview? ✅/❌
4. **Expected:** Iframe should solve CORS issues (if not, we'll need proxy)

**Test 4: Navigation & UX**
1. In both story and playlist previews:
2. **Check:** Swipe left/right works on mobile? ✅/❌
3. **Check:** Keyboard arrow keys work? ✅/❌
4. **Check:** Mouse wheel scrolling works? ✅/❌
5. **Check:** Fullscreen button works? ✅/❌
6. **Check:** Page counter shows correctly? ✅/❌

**Expected Results:**
- ✅ Preview auto-shows after saving
- ✅ Drive/Imgur images render (CORS solved by iframe)
- ✅ YouTube videos embed cleanly (no related videos)
- ✅ All navigation methods work (swipe, keyboard, wheel)
- ✅ Fullscreen mode works
- ✅ Mobile-responsive design

**If Issues Found:**
1. Take screenshots of errors
2. Check browser console for error messages
3. Note which specific images/videos fail
4. We'll debug together in next session

**Next Steps After Testing:**
1. If all tests pass → Merge dev branch to main in recursive-landing
2. Update iframe URLs in recursive-creator to point to main (recursive.eco)
3. Deploy to production
4. Move to Phase 2: Admin dashboard for story approval

**Current Files:**
- ✅ `app/dashboard/stories/new/page.tsx` - URL-based story creator
- ✅ `app/dashboard/playlists/new/page.tsx` - YouTube playlist creator
- ✅ `app/dashboard/page.tsx` - Dashboard with both stories and playlists
- ✅ `supabase/migrations/002-add-playlist-type.sql` - Playlist document type
- ⏳ `recursive-landing/pages/content/viewer.html` - To be created in dev branch

**Supabase Email Template (Magic Link + OTP):**

Go to: Supabase Dashboard → Authentication → Email Templates → Magic Link

```html
<h2>Sign in to Recursive.eco</h2>

<p>Click the link below to sign in:</p>
<p><a href="{{ .ConfirmationURL }}">Sign In</a></p>

<p><strong>Or enter this 6-digit code:</strong></p>
<p style="font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold; font-family: monospace;">{{ .Token }}</p>

<p style="font-size: 12px; color: #666;">
  This code expires in 1 hour.<br>
  If you didn't request this, you can safely ignore it.
</p>
```

**Key:** The `{{ .Token }}` variable includes the 6-digit OTP code

**Redirect URLs to Whitelist in Supabase:**
- Local: `http://localhost:3001/auth/callback`
- Preview: `https://*.vercel.app/auth/callback`
- Production: `https://creator.recursive.eco/auth/callback`

**Current Development Server:**

## Questions to Ask User (If Resuming and Unclear)

1. "What phase are we on?" (Check Current State)
2. "Should I continue with [next task]?" (Check Next Steps)
3. "Any decisions changed since last session?" (Validate context)
4. "Ready to start implementation?" (Get confirmation)

**If user says "continue," "let's go," or similar:**
→ Check Next Steps, create todos, start work!

## Quick Reference: What Changed in Sessions 3-4

### Files Modified:
1. `lib/supabase-client.ts` - Environment-aware cookie domain (best practice)
2. `lib/supabase-server.ts` - Environment-aware cookie domain (best practice)
3. `app/page.tsx` - Dark mode (bg-gray-900)
4. `components/auth/DualAuth.tsx` - Dark mode + sessionStorage for email
5. `app/auth/error/page.tsx` - Dark mode + OTP form + auto-prefilled email
6. `app/auth/callback/route.ts` - **CRITICAL FIX:** Now handles PKCE code exchange

### Critical Bug Fixed:
**Missing PKCE Code Handler** - Supabase sends `code` parameter (PKCE flow), but callback only handled `token_hash` + `type` (old magic link flow). Fixed by copying EXACT callback logic from recursive-channels-fresh which handles BOTH flows.

### How We Found It:
Vercel logs showed:
```
fullUrl: '...?code=af540734-95db-4ab9-ba31-3283f66cc36e'
❌ Missing token_hash or type in callback
```

This revealed callback was ignoring the `code` parameter completely.

### Features Added:
1. **Dark mode** across all auth pages
2. **OTP fallback** with sessionStorage email prefill
3. **Environment-aware cookies** (localhost, Vercel, production)
4. **PKCE code exchange** support (the missing piece!)

### Testing Status:
- ✅ All code matches working recursive-channels-fresh
- ✅ Supabase email template includes `{{ .Token }}`
- ⏳ Awaiting production test (should work now!)

### Next Session:
- Test auth on https://creator.recursive.eco/
- If working, copy improvements to other projects
- Start Phase 1 (story publisher features)
