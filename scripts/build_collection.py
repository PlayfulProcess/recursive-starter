"""Build grammars/_collection.json for The Recursive I Ching — the collection-index
file the ported viewers (cards.html, explorer.html, lenses.html, tree-viewer.html,
timeline.html) read to discover every grammar in this repo, in the SAME schema
recursive-tarot/tarot/_collection.json and recursive-astrology/grammars/_collection.json
use (only the root path differs: grammars/ here). Port of
recursive-astrology/scripts/build_collection.py, itself a port of recursive-tarot's
build_tarot_collection.py + refresh_collection.py, collapsed into one script since this
repo has no separate "migrate from source repo" step — the grammars already live in
grammars/*/grammar.json.

The grammar files are the source of truth for name/type/items/cover_image_url/blurb;
this script only ADDS curation this repo doesn't otherwise have anywhere (branch
grouping + a historical year where a grammar actually has one). Unlisted / future
grammars still get included automatically (glob-driven, no hardcoded slug list to fall
out of date) — they just land in the "synthesis" branch with no year, which reads
honestly as "undated / contemporary" rather than inventing a false date.
